"A review of literature on evaluating the scientific, social and political impact of social sciences and humanities research","scientific, social, political, impacts, Social Sciences and Humanities","Recently, the need to contribute to the evaluation of the scientific, social, and political impact of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) research has become a demand of policy makers and society. The international scientific community has made significant advances that have transformed the impact of evaluation landscape. This article reviews the existing scientific knowledge on evaluation tools and techniques that are applied to assess the scientific impact of SSH research; the changing structure of social and political impacts of SSH research is investigated based on an overarching research question: to what extent do scholars attempt to apply methods, instruments, and approaches that take into account the distinctive features of SSH? The review also includes examples of European Union (EU) projects that demonstrate these impacts. This article culminates in a discussion of the development of the assessment of different impacts and identifies limitations, and areas and topics to explore in the future."
"New Evidence on Instrumental, Conceptual, and Symbolic Utilization of University Research in Government Agencies","research utilization, instrumental use, conceptual use, symbolic use, ordered logit","This article addresses three questions: What is the 
extent of instrumental, conceptual, and symbolic use of university research in government agencies? Are there differences between the policy domains in regard to the extent of each type of use? What are the determinants of instrumental, conceptual, and symbolic use of university research? Based on a survey of 833 government officials, the results suggest that (1) the three types of use of research simultaneously play a significant role in government agencies, (2) there are large differences between policy domains in regard to research utilization, and (3) a small number of determinants explain the increase of instrumental, conceptual, and symbolic utilization of research in a different way."
Benchmarking scientific output in the social sciences and humanities: The limits of existing databases,"social sciences, humanities, Thomson Scientific databases, bibliometrics ","The goal of this paper is to examine the impact 
of linguistic coverage of databases used by bibliometricians on the capacity to effectively benchmark the work of researchers in social sciences and humanities. We examine the strong link between bibliometrics and the Thomson Scientific's database and review the differences in the production and diffusion of knowledge in the social sciences and humanities (SSH) and the natural sciences and engineering (NSE). This leads to a re-examination of the debate on the coverage of these databases, more specifically in the SSH. The methods section explains how we have compared the coverage of Thomson Scientific databases in the NSE and SSH to the Ulrich extensive database of journals. Our results show that there is a 20 to 25% overrepresentation of English-language journals in Thomson Scientific's databases compared to the list of journals presented in Ulrich. This paper concludes that because of this bias, Thomson Scientific databases cannot be used in isolation to benchmark the output of countries in the SSH."
"Evaluating research
and innovation policy: a systems world needs systems evaluations","knowledge production, systemic perspective, evaluation of research and innovation, theory","In the field of R&D policy at least, reality, theory and therefore 
the needs of evaluation users seem to have moved well ahead of evaluators' conceptual apparatus. The way we think about both innovation and how knowledge is produced has moved towards a systems perspective, while much of the research and innovation evaluation tool-kit has been developed to tackle interventions at the lower levels of projects and programmes. This paper reflects on these changes and what they may mean for the scope and practice of R&D evaluation."
"The Agora model of innovation systems: 
S&T indicators for a democratic knowledge society"," industrial innovation, public research, sociopolitical subsystems, government and social actors, Agora processes","‘Mode 2’ research and the precautionary principle change innovation 
systems from the classical to the Agora model. In this model the actors in industrial innovation public research and sociopolitical subsystems tend to mix together, and the first phase of the knowledge production processes (exploration, hypothesis and controversies) becomes hybrid. The ‘Agora processes’ — foresight, technology assessment, socioeconomic impact evaluation and benchmarking, which ensure the proper interactions between industry, academia, government and social actors — thus become major aspects of the functioning of the innovation systems and a component of a democratic knowledge society. S&T indicators, as expertise input into the Agora processes, cannot make claims for truth, but have the unique capability of generating significant debates through the criticism they stir, which can make them socially robust."
"Tracing how arts and humanities research translates, circulates and consolidates in society.. How have scholars been reacting to diverse impact and public value agendas?","Arts and humanities research, co-creation,
knowledge exchange, public value, valorisation","Arts and humanities research appears to have a problem when it comes to making an argument that it matters to society. Despite widespread efforts within and beyond the field to document how arts and humanities research creates social value, these arguments have had little traction within public policy debates. The paper argues that other disciplines 
have been able to mobilise an ‘investment logic’, based on a more nuanced model of how knowledge creates value, showing how investing in small research projects drives economic growth, highlighting, for instance, the direct links between universities, spin-offs, the biotech sector and large pharmaceutical firms. If one looks at arts and humanities research through this lens, it is possible to find examples of how individual pieces of arts and humanities research are translated upwards through first-order users, through networks, to create societal improvements: it is therefore possible to meaningfully argue for arts and humanities research driving societal value creation. The paper concludes by reflecting on how arts and humanities research might apply this wider model of research valorisation to better convey its societal benefits in contemporary science policy discussions."
The Utility of the Arts and Humanities,"arts, culture, education, humanities, sciences, utility","Artists and humanists who work in universities are generally ambivalent about the idea of defending their enterprises in terms of social utility: on the one hand they do not want to claim that the Arts and Humanities are such exalted and selfjustifying endeavors that no one need bother explainingwhy such things are worth pursuing, yet on the other hand they are rightly skeptical that cost-benefit analyses of academic labor will do justice to disciplines 
devoted to the varieties of human cultural expression rather than to the research and development of patentable forms of knowledge. This essay explores this ambivalence and suggests an alternative way of thinking about the ‘utility’ of cultural work."
"Bibliometrics: Use and Abuse in the 
Review of Research Performance: Proceedings from a symposium held in Stockholm, 23-25 May 2013","expansion, bibliometrics, technology yardstick, scientific progress","Over recent decades, the strong expansion of the number 
of researchers, the even stronger growth in the number of publication outlets, and managerial expansion have put heavy pressure on the peer-review system. Bibliometrics, which have been made possible by information technology, have increasingly become the yardstick for quality, a development which has been widely criticized by researchers. Biased measuring systems seemed to replace quality judgements, and the multiplication of evaluation work is even said to hamper scientific progress. In this volume, specialists from various disciplines criticize the mechanical use of uniquely metric assessment methods, which all have inherent systemic biases, and plead for the use of multidimensional tools. This book is based on the presentations and discussions at a symposium that was arranged jointly by the Academia Europaea and the Wenner-Gren Foundations and held in Stockholm in late May 2013."
"Fit for purpose? Assessing research
quality for evidence based policy and practice","policy, research quality, UK Cabinet Office, methodological quality, conducting research","There is a growing interest in evidence-based policy and practice
(EBPP) across Europe. However, if policy makers and practitioners are to use evidence to inform policy and practice they need to feel confident about its quality. This paper introduces some of the current debates about research quality, and a number of existing sets of standards. It describes a range of different notions of quality, including methodological quality, fitness for purpose and quality in reporting. It also describes current UK initiatives designed to take forward the debate on research quality, for the benefit of both research users and those conducting research. The roundtable session will begin with presentations of ‘work in progress’ emerging from two of these new initiatives, funded by the Strategy Unit in the UK Cabinet Office and the new UK Social Care Institute for Excellence."
"Scholarship in the Digital Age: Information, Infrastructure, and the Internet","internet, intellectual property, education, higher","Today's research and scholarship is data- and information-intensive, distributed, interdisciplinary, and collaborative. However, the 
scholarly practices, products, and sources of data vary widely between disciplines. Some fields are more advantaged than others by the array of content now online and by the tools and services available to make use of that content. UCLA Professor of Information Studies Christine Borgman provides an overview of new developments in scholarly information infrastructure, including policy issues such as open access and intellectual property, and addresses the implications of e-science for cyberlearning."
"What is Societal Impact of Research 
and How can it be Assessed? A Literature Survey","societal impact, societal quality, societal benefits, societal relevance, impact measurement
","Since the 1990s, the scope of research evaluations becomes broader as the societal products (outputs), societal use (societal references), and societal benefits (changes in society) of research come into scope. Society can reap the benefits of successful research studies only if the results are converted into marketable and consumable products (e.g., medicaments, diagnostic tools, machines, and devices) or services. A series of different names have been introduced which refer to the societal impact 
of research: third stream activities, societal benefits, societal quality, usefulness, public values, knowledge transfer, and societal relevance. What most of these names are concerned with is the assessment of social, cultural, environmental, and economic returns (impact and effects) from results (research output) or products (research outcome) of publicly funded research. This review intends to present existing research on and practices employed in the assessment of societal impact in the form of a literature survey. The objective is for this review to serve as a basis for the development of robust and reliable methods of societal impact measurement."
How Can Payback from Health Services Research Be Assessed?,"political and administrative benefits, cost-effectiveness of research, feasibility, impacts","Throughout the world there is a growing recognition that health care should be research-led. This strengthens the requirement for expenditure on health services research to be justified by demonstrating the benefits it produces. However, payback from health research and development is a complex concept and little used term. Five main categories of payback can be identified: Knowledge; research benefits; political and administrative benefits; health sector benefits; and broader economic benefits.
Various models of research utilization together with previous assessments of payback from research helped in the development of a new conceptual model of how and where payback may occur. The model combines an input-output perspective with an examination of the permeable interfaces between research and its environment. The model characterizes research projects in terms of Inputs, Processes, and Primary Outputs. The last consist of knowledge and research benefits. There are two interfaces between the project and its environment. The first (Project Specification, Selection and Commissioning) is the link with Research Needs Assessment. The second (Dissemination) should lead to Secondary Outputs (which are policy or administrative decisions), and usually Applications (which take the form of behavioural changes), from which Impacts or Final Outcomes result. It is at this final stage that health and wider economic benefits can be measured.
A series of case studies were used to assess the feasibility both of applying the model and the payback categorization. The paper draws various conclusions from the case studies and identifies a range of issues for further work."
Use of Evidence from Systematic Reviews to Inform Commissioning Decisions: A Case Study,"systematic reviews, methodological development and evaluation, political, community treatment","Systematic reviews provide high-level evidence but 
there are barriers to their use by policy makers. This paper reports the preparation and evaluation of an evidence briefing, using systematic reviews and other existing sources of synthesised evidence, to support a possible reorganisation of services for young people with eating disorders in an English primary care trust. There was no evidence of differences in outcomes between community, outpatient and specialist inpatient treatment. The provision of specialist outpatient services appeared most cost-effective. The commissioning group agreed to move towards providing services on an outpatient basis. This work suggests that evidence briefings based on systematic reviews warrant further methodological development and evaluation."

"Evaluation of research 
in context: an approach and two cases","research evaluation, investigation, scientific, societal, knowledge dynamics
","Science is increasingly heterogeneous, posing new questions for research 
evaluation. How can we evaluate the between scientific and societal quality of research, taking into account differences between research fields and between research groups? In this paper we present the findings of two case studies in fields where societal and scholarly output of research are highly intertwined (architecture and law). We analyze the nature of the two fields in terms of research areas and specific aspects of knowledge dynamics. This results in an approach and indicators for contextual research evaluation."
"Understanding societal 
impact through productive interactions: ICT research as a case","application and exploitation of knowledge, societal impact, communication technologies, social sciences and humanities","Universities are increasingly expected to fulfill a third mission
 in addition to those of research and education. Universities must demonstrate engagement with society through the application and exploitation of knowledge. As societal impact of research is uncertain, long term and always dependent on other factors, we argue here that evaluation should focus on the conditions under which societal impact is generated rather than on the impact itself. Here we focus on a specific set of those conditions: the interactions between academic researchers and societal actors. Instead of speculating about potential impacts of research, we argue that current productive interactions of researchers with societal stakeholders improve the probability that future societal impact will occur. This article supports this idea by examining in detail several, mainly retrospective examples. As productive interactions are field specific, we restrict ourselves to ‘professional adhocracy fields’, especially to information and communication technologies (ICT) research. We address the patterns of productive interactions that result in societal impact within this field and we discuss whether differences are observed in contrast to other fields, such as social sciences and humanities (fragmented adhocracies). We end by discussing the implications that these patterns have for societal impact assessment. Shifting the focus to interactions allows assessment of short-term knowledge transfer and other collaborative efforts with stakeholders that contribute to long-term societal impact."
Toward critical spatial thinking in the social sciences and humanities,"social sciences, humanities, methodologies, spatial, technologies,integration of scientific ","The integration of geographically referenced information into the conceptual frameworks and applied uses of the social sciences and humanities has been an ongoing process over the past few centuries. It has gained momentum in recent decades with advances in technologies for computation and visualization and with the arrival of new data sources. This article begins with an overview of this transition, and argues that the spatial integration of 
information resources and the cross-disciplinary sharing of analysis and representation methodologies are important forces for the integration of scientific and artistic expression, and that they draw on core concepts in spatial (and spatio-temporal) thinking. We do not suggest that this is akin to prior concepts of unified knowledge systems, but we do maintain that the boundaries to knowledge transfer are disintegrating and that our abilities in problem solving for purposes of artistic expression and scientific development are enhanced through spatial perspectives. Moreover, approaches to education at all levels must recognize the need to impart proficiency in the critical and efficient application of these fundamental spatial concepts, if students and researchers are to make use of expanding access to a broadening range of spatialized information and data processing technologies."
"What is Special About 
Spatial Data? Alternative Perspectives on Spatial Data Analysis","spatial data analysis, spatial statistics, spatial econometrics ","Outlines general ideas on fundamental issues related to the 
distinctive characteristics of spatial data analysis as opposed to data analysis in general. Focuses on two issues that are often overlooked in technical treatments of the methods of spatial statistics and spatial econometrics. One is therelevance for spatial data analysis of the ongoing debate about methodology in the disciplines of statistics and econometrics. The other is much narrower and pertains to the role of spatial errors in modeling and analysis. Includes an extensive bibliography.

Local Indicators of Spatial Association—LISA,"geographic information systems, data analysis, spatial association, magnitude of the global statistic, spatial association","The capabilities for visualization, rapid data retrieval, and manipulation in geographic information systems (GIS) have created the need for new techniques of exploratory data analysis that focus on the “spatial” aspects of the data. The identification of local patterns of spatial association is an important concern in this respect. In this paper, I outline a new general class of local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and show how they allow for the decomposition of global indicators, such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each observation. The LISA statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators 
of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Gi and G*i statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identify “outliers,” as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial evaluation of the properties of a LISA statistic is carried out for the local Moran, which is applied in a study of the spatial pattern of conflict for African countries and in a number of Monte Carlo simulations."

No Place in History – Geo-ICT and Historical Science,"Geographical information systems, Geography, GIS, Historical science, History","Geographical information systems (GIS) can be powerful
 tools for historical science: for presentation, exploration, analysis and reconstruction, as a portal to historical information and to facilitate research. In fact, very limited use has actually been made of them. Where GIS has been used, it has been outside traditional historical departments, in economics, geography or sociology. In general, history departments remain very reluctant to include modern research methods such as GIS in their curricula. As a consequence, there is no place in history."
Spatial Demography: An Opportunity to Improve Policy Making at Diverse Decision Levels,"spatial demography, spatial statistical models, fertility, mortality, migration","The number of applications of spatial demography 
has been growing mostly since the 1990s. Ranging from simple visualization to sophisticated spatial analytical techniques, these applications bring a new layer of explanation to demographic phenomena. This paper reviews demographic studies that specifically addressed space with spatial statistical models, and that focused on fertility, mortality, migration, and population models. Additionally, it summarizes different spatial datasets and software freely available, as well as the challenges that exist for the development of spatial demography applications. These challenges include confidentiality issues, scale problems, and the lack of training on spatial analysis in population centers. Although the first and second challenges involve modeling and technical solutions, the latter depends only on demographers’ commitment and willingness to promote change. Several topics for future spatially focused research are also outlined. Finally, the paper makes a strong case regarding the significant contribution that spatial demography can make to the monitoring, evaluation, and implementation of population policies."
Understanding and representing ‘place’ in health research: A relational approach,"Place, Space, Neighbourhood effects, Relational theory, Geography","Epidemiology, sociology, and geography have been successful in re-establishing interest in the role of place in shaping health and health inequalities. However, some of the relevant empirical research has relied on rather conventional conceptions of 
space and place and focused on isolating the “independent” contribution of place-level and individual-level factors. This approach may have resulted in an underestimate of the contribution of ‘place’ to disease risk. In this paper we argue the case for extensive (quantitative) as well as intensive (qualitative) empirical, as well as theoretical, research on health variation that incorporates ‘relational’, views of space and place. Specifically, we argue that research in place and health should avoid the false dualism of context and composition by recognising that there is a mutually reinforcing and reciprocal relationship between people and place. We explore in the discussion how these theoretical perspectives are beginning to influence empirical research. We argue that these approaches to understanding how place relates to health are important in order to deliver effective, ‘contextually sensitive’ policy interventions."

Citizens as sensors: the world of volunteered geography,"geographic, science, geographic observation, geographic observation,
phenomenon","In recent months there has been an explosion of interest in 
the Web to create, assemble, and disseminate geographic information provided voluntarily by individuals. Sites such as Wikimapia and OpenStreetMap are empowering citizens to create a global patchwork of geographic information, while Google Earth and other virtual globes are encouraging volunteers to develop interesting applications using their own data. I review this phenomenon, and examine associated issues: what drives people to do this, how accurate are the results, will they threaten individual privacy, and how can they augment more conventional sources? I compare this new phenomenon to more traditional citizen science and the role of the amateur in geographic observation."
A Framework for the Areal Interpolation of Socioeconomic Data,"Spatial, spatial objects, socioeconomic data, density surfaces, 
geographical information","Spatial data are collected and represented as attributes 
of spatial objects embedded in a plane. Basis change is defined as the transfer of attributes from one set of objects to another. Methods of basis change for socioeconomic data are reviewed and are seen to differ in the assumptions made in each about underlying density surfaces. These methods are extended to more general cases, and an illustration is provided by using Californian data. The implementation of this framework within a geographical information system is discussed."

The authors review the emerging interest in space and place in the recent social science literature and develop a vision for a spatially integrated social science. This vision provides the conceptual basis for a program of six activities designed to promote a spatial perspective: learning resources, workshops, best-practice examples, place-based search, software tools, and a virtual community. The six programs will be informed by advances in the methods, technologies, and principles underlying spatial information science."
"The early history of digital humanities: An analysis of Computers and the Humanities 
(1966–2004) and Literary and Linguistic Computing (1986–2004)","digital humanities, classification systems, digital technology, analysis, history","Most commentators locate the origin of digital humanities (DH) in computational text analysis of the mid-twentieth century, beginning in 1946 with Roberto Busa’s plans for the Index Thomisticus, a massive attempt to encode nearly 11 million words of Thomas Aquinas’ writings on IBM punch cards. This event (and the narrative that follows) is found throughout the literature, leading some to believe that early DH work ‘concentrated, perhaps somewhat narrowly, on text analysis (such as classification systems, mark-up, text encoding, and scholarly editing)’ (Presner, 2010, p. 6). Others seem convinced that DH is still only text analysis or too dominated by it (Meeks, 2013)—and misguided in its approach (Fish, 2012). Meanwhile, Underwood (2017) has recently made a case for disentangling distant reading methods from DH generally, noting that the former predates and does not depend on digital technology.

This article presents an empirical perspective on the early history of DH by tracing publications in two foundational journals (Computers and the Humanities (CHum), established in 1966, and Literary and Linguistic Computing (LLC), established in 1986), with particular emphasis on media types, authors’ disciplines and locations, and teaching and learning. In doing so, we examine the extent to which early DH work focused on text analysis as well as broader trends in the early history of the field."
"Revising the Visualizer-Verbalizer Dimension: Evidence for Two Types of 
Visualizers","visualizer-verbalizer, cognitive, spatial ability, dimension, homogeneous group","Sixty participants were administered spatial ability tests, a verbal ability test, and a visualizer-verbalizer cognitive style questionnaire. Although verbalizers tended to be a homogeneous group with an intermediate level of spatial ability, there were 2 groups of visualizers, 1 with high spatial ability (the spatial type) and another with low spatial ability (the iconic type). To compare the use of mental images by the 2 types of visualizers in solving problems, interviews with 8 high-spatial 
visualizers and 9 low-spatial visualizers were conducted. The students were presented with graphs of motion and were asked to visualize and interpret the motion of an object. Whereas low-spatial visualizers interpreted the graphs as pictures and mostly relied on visual (iconic) imagery, high-spatial visualizers constructed more schematic images and manipulated them spatially. In addition, we compared problem-solving strategies used by verbalizers to those of visualizers. In contrast to visualizers, verbalizers of low and high spatial ability did not have any clearly marked preference to use visual or spatial imagery."
Spatial versus object visualizers: A new characterization of visual cognitive style,"spatial properties, neuropsychological, spatial, object, spatial imagery","The visual system processes object properties (such as shape and color) and spatial properties (such as location and spatial relations) in distinct systems, and neuropsychological evidence reveals that mental imagery respects this distinction. The findings reported in this article demonstrate that verbalizers typically perform at anintermediate level on imagery tasks, whereas visualizers can be divided into two groups. Specifically, scores on spatial and object imagery tasks, along with a visualizer-verbalizer cognitive style questionnaire, identified a group of visualizers who scored poorly on spatial imagery tasks but excelled on object imagery tasks. 
In contrast, a second group of visualizers scored high on spatial imagery tasks but poorly on object imagery tasks. The results also indicate that object visualizers encode and process images holistically, as a single perceptual unit, whereas spatial visualizers generate and process images analytically, part by part. In addition, we found that scientists and engineers excel in spatial imagery and prefer spatial strategies, whereas visual artists excel in object imagery and prefer object-based strategies."
Sharing Teaching Ideas: Why Not Three Dimensions?,"analysis, dimensions, visualizations, spatial skills, rotations","When I reviewed our high school curriculum, I realized that my
 students did not have enough practice with situations that required analysis in three dimensions. Few situations that applied the threedimensional ideas studied in geometry were found in second-year algebra and precalculus, and calculus students faced with rotations that produced solids had very little experience to help them with the visualizations required. As a response, I developed several projects that I integrated into my courses at all three levels. What follows are descriptions of a three-year sequence of projects that help to develop students' spatial skills. The photographs are all examples of student-produced work."
Virtual Geographic Environments (VGEs): A New Generation of Geographic Analysis Tool,"Virtual Geographic Environments (VGEs), Spatial analysis, Interaction, Geographic phenomenon simulation, 
Collaborative geographic experiment","Virtual Geographic Environments (VGEs) 
are proposed as a new generation of geographic analysis tool to contribute to human understanding of the geographic world and assist in solving geographic problems at a deeper level. The development of VGEs is focused on meeting the three scientific requirements of Geographic Information Science (GIScience) — multi-dimensional visualization, dynamic phenomenon simulation, and public participation. To provide a clearer image that improves user understanding of VGEs and to contribute to future scientific development, this article reviews several aspects of VGEs. First, the evolutionary process from maps to previous GISystems and then to VGEs is illustrated, with a particular focus on the reasons VGEs were created. Then, extended from the conceptual framework and the components of a complete VGE, three use cases are identified that together encompass the current state of VGEs at different application levels: 1) a tool for geo-object-based multi-dimensional spatial analysis and multi-channel interaction, 2) a platform for geo-process-based simulation of dynamic geographic phenomena, and 3) a workspace for multi-participant-based collaborative geographic experiments. Based on the above analysis, the differences between VGEs and other similar platforms are discussed to draw their clear boundaries. Finally, a short summary of the limitations of current VGEs is given, and future directions are proposed to facilitate ongoing progress toward forming a comprehensive version of VGEs."
Transition to a bioeconomy: Perspectives from social sciences,"Systematic review, Bioeconomy, Social sciences, Bioresources, Socioeconomic impacts","More than 50 countries and international organisations worldwide are currently working on strategies and policies to promote a transition to a bioeconomy. This economic system centres on a sustainable use of bio- and renewable resources to guarantee sustainability. Although many contributions have been made to the field of bioeconomy, most focus on a science perspective (e.g. chemistry, engineering, technology, biomedicine or biology). Despite the significant importance of social and economic issues for a bioeconomy transition, studies from a social science perspective are largely lacking. This paper presents a systematic review of academic contributions to the field of bioeconomy from a social science standpoint. The results reveal the need for an in-depth analysis of the challenges and opportunities that the bioeconomy faces in social and economic terms."
Public perceptions of using forests to fuel the European bioeconomy: Findings from eight university cities,"Lay perception, Legitimacy, Network analysis, Public discourse, Risk perception, 
Socio-technical transition","The political project on bioeconomy strives to address multiple societal aspirations, namely combine economic growth with environmental sustainability in some socially acceptable manner. The contradictions between the goals and the concrete plans to increase production, processing, and consumption of forest biomass in Europe have however raised sustainability concerns within and beyond its borders. While political actors articulate such contradictions differently and compete 
for traction for their viewpoints in the public discourse, little is known about how citizens of urban areas perceive this discourse. Conceptualising perception as a multidimensional construct, data from eight European university cities (Bordeaux, Bratislava, Freiburg, Helsinki, Padua, St. Petersburg, Uppsala, Vienna) are statistically analysed to explore its dimensions, the communities of like-minded citizens forming across those dimensions, and the traits associating with membership in each such community. Five communities across six dimensions from biocentrism through distributional aspects to adherence to political goals are identified: adherent-environmentalist, adherent-governmentalist, critical-reformist, critical-agriculturalist, and indifferent. City of residence and perceived familiarity with bioeconomy clearly interact with perception. There is however considerable variation in communities within and across the eight cities, suggesting deeper social tension beyond the public discourse. Much of the within-community variation remains unexplained, though, calling for more work locally. Implications for forest policy are derived."
Socioeconomic impact of 2005–2008 drought in Andalusian agriculture,"Economic surplus, Hydrological drought, Impact assessment, Irrigation,
Rainfed","Meteorological drought is defined as the event 
that arises when precipitation is lower than average and initially affects rainfed crops; this is transformed into hydrological drought when persistent drought affects water storage. We have studied the economic impact of multiyear droughts by applying the economic surplus to the last severe drought (2005–2008) in Andalusia. The method is applied to both rainfed and irrigated agriculture. The results show negative effects on regional social welfare, with an estimated global loss of EUR 1512 million, although this negative impact is unequally distributed. There is a quantity effect (lower yields) and higher prices due to shorter supply. Overall, rainfed farms experience a negative impact on their income since higher prices only partially compensate for yield reduction, although, paradoxically, certain irrigation farms increase their income when higher prices overcorrect lower yields. Consumers are always negatively affected by drought. This result may aid in the design of agricultural policy models and drought-recovery policies."
Reuse of sea water reverse osmosis brine to produce Dunaliella salina based β-carotene as a valuable bioproduct: A circular bioeconomy perspective,"β-Carotene, Bioproduct, Biorefinery, Bioeconomy, Reuse, Microalgae","Due to population growth and global warming, the use of the sea water reverse osmosis process to obtain freshwater is increasing rapidly. A sustainable method with low environmental impact is limited for the management of brine with a high salt content, which is released as a result of the process. Some microalgae species can grow in salty environments and produce β-carotene. This study 
aims to evaluate the commercial potential of β-carotene production from microalgae grown in sea water reverse osmosis brine from a bioeconomy perspective. Synthetic media are often used for the production of β-carotene from algae, the use of sea water reverse osmosis brine is not common and the commercial potential of this application has not been evaluated before. In terms of the development of the β-carotene market, the strengths and weaknesses of the process, opportunities, and threats are thoroughly examined in this report. Also, with the use of sea water reverse osmosis, a daily 750 tons of algal β-carotene can be produced. The biotechnological production of microalgal β-carotene and the reuse of salt water within the scope of circular bioeconomy are seen as a sustainable solution due to the fact that the strengths of the process are dominant, and the market value of natural β-carotene is increasing day by day."
Sustainability implications of transformation pathways for the bioeconomy,"Bioeconomy, Bio-based transformation, Transformation pathway, 
Sustainability, Governance","Countries around the world are devising and implementing bioeconomy strategies to initiate transformation towards sustainable futures. Modern concepts of bioeconomy extend beyond bio-based energy provision and include: (1) the substitution of fossil resource-based inputs to various productive sectors, such as the chemical industry and the construction sector, (2) more efficient, including new and cascading uses of biomass, and (3) a low bulk, but high-value biologisation of processes in agro-food, pharmaceutical, and recycling industries. Outcomes of past attempts at engineering transformation, however, proved to be context-dependent and contingent on appropriate governance measures. In this paper we theoretically motivate and apply a system-level theory of change framework that identifies central mechanisms and four distinct pathways, through which bio-based transformation can generate positive or negative outcomes in multiple domains of the Sustainable Development Goals. Based on emblematic examples from three bio-based sectors, we apply the framework illustrating 
how case-specific mixes of transformation pathways emerge and translate into outcomes. We find that the observed mixes of transformation pathways evoke distinct mechanisms that link bioeconomic change to sustainability gains and losses. Based on this insight we derive four key lessons that can help to inform the design of strategies to enable and regulate sustainable bioeconomies."
Macroalgal biorefinery concepts for the circular bioeconomy: A review on biotechnological developments and future perspectives,"Seaweed, Biomass, Bioproducts, Bioprocessing, Biotechnology, Biorefinery","The imminent need for transition to a circular bioeconomy, 
based on the valorisation of renewable biomass feedstocks, will ameliorate global challenges induced by climate change, environmental pollution and population growth. A reduced reliance on depleting fossil fuel resources and ensured production of eco-friendly and cost-effective bioproducts and biofuels, requires the development of sustainable biorefinery processes, with many utilising macroalgae as feedstock, showing promising and viable prospects. Nonetheless, macroalgal biorefinery research is still in its infancy compared to lignocellulosic biorefineries that utilise terrestrial plants. This article presents a review on the latest scientific literature associated with the development and status of macroalgal biorefineries, and how bioproducts generated from these bioprocesses have contributed towards the bioeconomy. The fundamental need to understand how the unique biochemical composition of macroalgae fit within a biorefinery concept are explained, alongside discussion of the novel biotechnologies that have been applied. In order to comprehend the increasing significance of this exciting field, the review will also provide insight, for the first time, on the current global funding and intellectual property landscape related to macroalgae and their implementation across the entire biorefinery concept. Imperative areas for further research and development, to bridge the gap between fundamental bioscience in the laboratory and the successful application of compatible biotechnologies at a commercial scale, to boost the macroalgae industry are also covered."
What if consumers saw the bigger picture? Systems thinking and the adoption of bio-based consumer products,"Systems thinking, Bio-based products, Bioeconomy, Pro-environmental behavior, Mediation analysis","Systems thinking (ST) represents an important cognitive paradigm 
for the transition towards a circular bio-economy, as greater awareness of the environmental impact of fossil-based products may lead to a switch to sustainable alternatives produced from secondary biomass which is not used as feed or food. However, the relationship between ST and the adoption of bio-based products, as well as the general mechanism of how ST affects environmental behavior, is not yet well-understood. The present study therefore aims to close these research gaps by conducting a survey-based experiment with a ST-motivated treatment, in which participants are asked to list as many consequences of their consumption behavior as possible (N=446 US consumers). Our findings suggest that the treatment is able to slightly activate a ST perspective, along with indirectly affecting consumer intentions to buy bio-based products by means of ST. Subsequent mediation analyses further reveal that an ecological worldview as well as variables from the norm-activation model function as mediators of the relationship between ST and purchase intention."
"Smart and Sustainable Bioeconomy Platform: A New Approach towards 
Sustainability ","bioeconomy, digitalization, platform-based bioeconomy, smart and sustainable 
development, governance","The smart and sustainable bioeconomy represents a 
comprehensive perspective, in which economic, social, environmental, and technological dimensions are considered simultaneously in the planning, monitoring, evaluating, and redefining of processes and operations. In this context of profound transformation driven by rapid urbanization and digitalization, participatory and interactive strategies and practices have become fundamental to support policymakers, entrepreneurs, and citizens in the transition towards a smart and sustainable bioeconomy. This approach is applied by numerous countries around the world in order to redefine their strategy of sustainable and technology-assisted development. Specifically, real-time monitoring stations, sensors, Internet of Things (IoT), smart grids, GPS tracking systems, and Blockchain aim to develop and strengthen the quality and efficiency of the circularity of economic, social, and environmental resources. In this sense, this study proposes a systematic review of the literature of smart and sustainable bioeconomy strategies and practices implemented worldwide in order to develop a platform capable of integrating holistically the following phases: (1) planning and stakeholder management; (2) identification of social, economic, environmental, and technological dimensions; and (3) goals. The results of this analysis emphasise an innovative and under-treated perspective, further stimulating knowledge in the theoretical and managerial debate on the smart and sustainable aspects of the bioeconomy, which mainly concern the following: (a) the proactive involvement of stakeholders in planning; (b) the improvement of efficiency and quality of economic, social, environmental, and technological flows; and (c) the reinforcement of the integration between smartness and sustainability."
"China’s Socioeconomic and CO2 Status Concerning Future Land-Use 
Change under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways ","land-use change, population, GDP, carbon emission, SSP scenario, China","China has experienced a huge socioeconomic advancement over 
the past few decades, resulting in great change in land use and land cover. To date, negligible attention has been given to examining the socioeconomic changes in the context of land-use change, especially from a futuristic standpoint. However, motivated by China’s latest carbon neutrality target, this study analyzes the prospective changes in socioeconomic status, and carbon dioxide emission in the context of future land-use change, focusing on three future periods: 2026–2030 (carbon dioxide peak phase), 2056–2060 (carbon-neutral phase), and 2080–2099 (long-term period). In this regard, recently published land-use products under seven Shared Socioeconomic Pathways-based scenarios (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP4-3.4, SSP2-4.5, SSP4-6.0, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5) as part of the CMIP6, as well as the projected GDP and population under five socioeconomic scenarios are used. To estimate socioeconomic change over prominent land-use types (urban), we combined five socioeconomic scenarios with seven corresponding SSPs-based land-use change scenarios (SSP1 with SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6; SSP2 with SSP2-4.5; SSP3 with SSP3-7.0; SSP4 with SSP4-3.4 and SSP4-6.0; and SSP5 with SSP5-8.5 scenarios). Our results reveal that rapid urban land expansion in the future is the most dominant aspect in China. In the carbon neutrality phase (2056–2060), urban land is expected to expand ~80% more than that of the reference period (1995–2014). In the spatial aspect, the expansion of urban land is mainly prominent in the eastern and central parts of China. For socioeconomic changes, the most prominent increase in the urban population is estimated at 630.8% under SSP5-8.5 for the 2056–2060 period compared to the reference period. Regarding GDP for the urban area, industrial GDP will be higher than service GDP in the carbon emission peak phase (2026–2030), but it is projected to be overtaken by service GDP for the carbon-neutral target (2056–2060) and long-term periods (2080–2099). Further, the CO2 emission in China was found to increase with intensified urban land for the historical period (1995–2019). In the future, the largest increase in CO2 emission from the urban area is anticipated under SSP5-8.5 in the carbon-neutral target (2056–2060) phase, while CO2 emission will largely decline after (2056–2060) under SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, and SSP4-3.4. Importantly, population change is expected to be the most predominant factor in future urban land expansion in China. These findings highlight the importance of well-governed urban-land development as a key measure to achieve China’s carbon neutrality goal."
"Framework Proposal to Quantify the Contribution of Non-Wood 
Forest Products to the European Union Forest-Based Bioeconomy ","social accounting matrix, environmental accounting, supply chains, forest sector, non-wood forest products","Forest ecosystems provide numerous services that contribute 
to the wellbeing of societies. However, the lack of knowledge about the benefits of non-wood forest ecosystem services, such as non-wood forest products (NWFPs), hinders efficient forest policy decision-making processes. This study proposes a new extension of the Social Accounting Matrices (SAMs) to capture both the private and the social component of NWFPs. By means of a literature review, we show how extended SAMs can be a suitable approach to explain the causal relationship between the supply of forest ecosystem services, forest-based value chains, and the European bioeconomy. The literature analysis shows that the number of research studies calibrating or using SAMs has been increasing over the last decades. Recent extensions of the SAMs made it possible to evaluate the relationship between human wellbeing and the environment. Moreover, we found applications to the forest sector (limited to timber) and to the supply of some non-wood ecosystem services. We believe the extended SAMs will support decision-makers to design forest strategies that properly account for the benefits NWFPs provide to both the economy and the society."

momentum during the last few years. The bioeconomy envisions “3R”, the goal of 3R (Reduce, Recycle, Reuse) is to implement in circular economy preventing excessive and unnecessary wastes. The circular bioeconomy emphasizes the best use of all sorts of available bioresources through the reduction of generated wastes during product formation, recycling of generated wastes, and reuse of valuable by-products and residues. Biotechnology could be useful in utilizing the resources to the optimum and therefore the role of biological agents and bioprocesses is of prime importance. In this review, we highlight the paramount importance of beneficial strains of microorganisms, macro, and microalgae in the bioeconomy. Microorganisms are universally recognized for the notable production of a vast array of secondary metabolites and other functionalities with possible use in various sectors. The application of potential strains in industries and modern agriculture practices could progressively improve the effective yield of food and feed, including fertilization of arid soils, bioconversion of by-products from industrial processes, and agriculture wastes. The valuable properties of specifically selected biological agents typically make them suitable candidates for their efficient contribution to circular bioeconomy without hampering the environment."

distinct applications ","Xylose isomerase, xylose, lignocellulosic biomass, isomerase, 
biorefinery, enzyme, biotechnology","Isomerases are enzymes that induce physical changes in a 
molecule without affecting the original molecular formula. Among this class of enzymes, xylose isomerases (XIs) are the most studied to date, partly due to their extensive application in industrial processes to produce high-fructose corn sirups. In recent years, the need for sustainable initiatives has triggered efforts to improve the biobased economy through the use of renewable raw materials. In this context, D-xylose usage is crucial as it is the second-most abundant sugar in nature. The application of XIs in biotransforming xylose, enabling downstream metabolism in several microorganisms, is a smart strategy for ensuring a low-carbon footprint and producing several value-added biochemicals with broad industrial applications such as in the food, cosmetics, pharmaceutical, and polymer industries. Considering recent advancements that have expanded the range of applications of XIs, this review provides a comprehensive and concise overview of XIs, from their primary sources to the biochemical and structural features that influence their mechanisms of action. This comprehensive review may help address the challenges involved in XI applications in different industries and facilitate the exploitation of xylose bioprocesses."
Using fuzzy cognitive maps to identify better policy strategies to valorize organic waste flows: An Italian case study,"Italy, Circular bioeconomy, Organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW), 
Policy scenarios, Policy mixes","In Europe, there is a vast amount of municipal waste available. The organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) represents a particularly valuable 
part of this waste, due to its potential to be employed to produce a range of value-added products. While several studies have addressed the utilization of the OFMSW in the Italian context, an overall picture of how the circular bioeconomy (CBE) model is being implemented in Italy is lacking. Accordingly, the present study investigated the status quo of the Italian bioeconomy sector, focusing on the use of the OFMSW as feedstock. The research aimed at increasing our understanding of barriers to the effective adoption of the CBE and identifying effective policy strategies. Specifically, a fuzzy cognitive mapping technique using an artificial neural network model was used to assess the impact of both single policy measures and policy mixes on a sample of selected outcomes, including human health, the environment, profitability and biorefinery approach. The results clearly showed that excessive bureaucracy, linear logic and technology-based solutions ignoring the complex characteristics of waste planning activities were the most important variables influencing the implementation of the CBE in Italy. Moreover, the results suggested that a policy mix combining economic and financial support policies for sustainable activities alongside improvements to waste collection systems could generate the highest positive effect on all considered outcomes."
"The knowledge based agricultural bioeconomy: 
A bibliometric network analysis ","bioeconomy, agriculture, bibliometric analysis, VOS viewer","The last ten years have witnessed an increase in publications 
focusing on bioeconomy as a proposal to confront the global challenges of climate change, depletion of non-renewable resources and ecosystem degradation. This paper investigates the scientific literature on issues related agricultural bioeconomy by applying a bibliometric network analysis. Bibliometric analysis is applied to the publications of the Scopus database during the period 2010–2020 in order to provide an overview of the main aspects that characterize agricultural bioeconomy. The results showed that out of a total of 1100 scientific papers, only 2.45% were published in 2010, while the corresponding share in 2020 was 20.81%. In the five years of 2016–2020, cumulatively, 70.63% of the publications were made, showing the dynamic evolution of bioeconomy. In addition, out of 85 countries in total, Germany and Italy are the two countries with most publications, while the fragmentation of research is evident with the creation of two main nodes, the European and the American. Moreover, keyword analysis showed that biomass and sustainability are two main recurring concepts, confirming that, currently, bioeconomy operates at three different levels: energy demand, land demand, and governance. It is apparent that to boost the development of agricultural bioeconomy, the following aspects should be assessed: the effective use of resources, an understanding of the key drivers of agricultural bioeconomy, and a clear perception of their associations. There is still no consensus as to which are the key factors that will accelerate its sustainable development. Our pursuit is to use the tools of bibliometric analysis to reach more critical conclusions regarding the agricultural bioeconomy, rather than approach it in a static way."
Consumer willingness to pay for bio-based products: Do certifications matter? ,"Artefactual field experiment, Bio-based products, Circular bioeconomy, Sustainability certification, Willingness to pay","European Commission aims to promote a more efficient and 
harmonized policy regulation framework for the market-pull of bio-based products. We conduct an artefactual field experiment in Italy, that demonstrates the existence of a “green premium”, which refers to increased consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for bio-based over conventional products, and a “certified green premium”, which refers to an additional increase in consumer WTP for certified bio-based products over and above other bio-based products. This experiment measures consumer preference through an incentive compatible procedure using 1080 observations. Moreover, we show that, across different product typologies (i.e. hand soap, food bags, colored pens), demand for conventional products is generally more elastic than demand for bio-based and certified bio-based products. Our evidence underlines that certification may play a key role in purchase decision making, especially for products in the food and nutrition and personal care categories. The diffusion of certified bio-based products may therefore prove effective for overcoming economic challenges related to the implementation of the circular bioeconomy. Social involvement is necessary to make certification an informative tool for consumers to encourage them to make green purchases. In fact, bio-based products combined with proper management at the end of their life cycle represent the concept of a circular bioeconomy. Certification therefore becomes the visible output to consumers of the actual sustainability of these products. Furthermore, the higher demand elasticity of conventional products suggests that even moderate price increases may have a significant impact on consumer preference for more sustainable products."
"Integrating the green economy, circular economy 
and bioeconomy in a strategic sustainability framework ","Ecosystem services, Low carbon economy, Nature-positive economy, Sharing economy, Sustainability transitions, System thinking","The green economy, circular economy and bioeconomy are popular narratives in macro-level sustainability discussions in policy, scientific research and business. These three narratives offer three different recipes to address economic, social and ecological goals, thus promoting different pathways for sustainability transformations. 
We employ the well-known Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (The Natural Step Framework) to comparatively identify the relative and integrated contribution of the three narratives for global net sustainability. We conclude that none of the three narratives, individually, offer a comprehensive ‘package’ of solutions. However, when considered jointly as collaborative narratives, they point towards a society and economy based on renewable/reproductive and biodiversity-based/benign processes, delivering material and immaterial benefits that fulfil the economic and social requirements of all people now and in the future. While the complementary understanding of the circular economy, bioeconomy and green economy provides important guidelines for sustainability transformations post-Covid-19, there is a need for more holistic, systems-wide and integrative research work on potentially competing or supplementary sustainability narratives. This type of work of clarification and synthesis is relevant to a wide range of scholars and professionals, since the conceptual understanding of sustainability narratives informs practical implementation through strategies, actions and monitoring tools, in public and private decision-making."

systems has been the focus of many research efforts in recent years
and has numerous applications in areas such as security,

Here, we propose a deep transfer learning (DTL) approach that
integrates transfer learning techniques and convolutional neural

tune facial recognition models. Transfer learning can allow for the
training of robust, high-performance machine learning models that
require much less time and resources to produce than similarly
performing models that have been trained from scratch. Using a pre-
trained face recognition model, we were able to perform transfer
learning to produce a network that is capable of making accurate
predictions on much smaller datasets. We also compare our results
with results produced by a selection of classical algorithms on the
same datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DTL
approach.

In this paper, we propose a use one RGB meal image as input to a multi-task learning based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The proposed approach achieved outstanding performance, while a comparison with state-of-the-art methods indicated that the proposed approach exhibits clear advantage in accuracy, along with a massive reduction of processing time."
Deep probabilistic human pose estimation,"Deterministic, equiprobable hypotheses, probabilistic convolutional, probabilistic models","The authors consider the problem of human pose estimation using probabilistic convolutional

They explore ways to improve human pose estimation accuracy on standard pose estimation benchmarks MPII human pose and Leeds Sports Pose (LSP) datasets using frameworks for probabilistic deep learning. Such frameworks transform deterministic neural network into a probabilistic one and allow sampling of independent and equiprobable hypotheses (different outputs) for a given input. Overlapping body parts and body joints hidden under clothes or other obstacles make the problem of human pose estimation ambiguous. In this context to get accurate estimation of joints’ position they use uncertainty in network's predictions, which is represented by variance of hypotheses, provided by a probabilistic convolutional neural network, and confidence is characterised by mean of them. Their work is based on current CNN cascades for pose estimation. They propose and evaluate three probabilistic convolutional neural networks built on top of deterministic ones with two probabilistic deep learning frameworks – DISCO networks and Bayesian SegNet. The authors evaluate their models on standard pose estimation benchmarks and show that proposed probabilistic models outperform base deterministic ones."
Deep Region of Interest and Feature Extraction Models for Palmprint Verification Using Convolutional Neural Networks Transfer Learning,"region of interest extraction, palm print verification, deep learning, convolutional neural network, transfer learning, feature extraction","Palmprint verification is one of the most significant and popular approaches for personal 
authentication due to its high accuracy and efficiency. Using deep region of interest (ROI) and feature extraction models for palmprint verification, a novel approach is proposed where convolutional neural networks (CNNs) along with transfer learning are exploited. The extracted palmprint ROIs are fed to the final verification system, which is composed of two modules. These modules are (i) a pre-trained CNN architecture as a feature extractor and (ii) a machine learning classifier. In order to evaluate our proposed model, we computed the intersection over union (IoU) metric for ROI extraction along with accuracy, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and equal error rate (EER) for the verification task.The experiments demonstrated that the ROI extraction module could significantly find the appropriate palmprint ROIs, and the verification results were crucially precise. This was verified by different databases and classification methods employed in our proposed model. In comparison with other existing approaches, our model was competitive with the state-of-the-art approaches that rely on the representation of hand-crafted descriptors. We achieved a IoU score of 93% and EER of 0.0125 using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for the contact-based Hong Kong Polytechnic University Palmprint (HKPU) database. It is notable that all codes are open-source and can be accessed online."
Comparisons of Deep Learning Algorithms for MNIST in Real-Time Environment,"Capsule networks, Dynamic routing, Residual learning, CNN, Logistic regression","Recognizing handwritten digits was challenging task in a couple of years ago. 
Thanks to machine learning algorithms, today, the issue has solved but those algorithms require much time to train and to recognize digits. Thus, using one of those algorithms to an application that works in real-time, is complex. Notwithstanding use of a trained model, if the model uses deep neural networks it requires much more time to make a prediction and becomes more complicated as well as memory usage also increases. It leads real-time application to delay and to work slowly even using trained model. A memory usage is also essential as using smaller memory of trained models works considerable faster comparing to models with huge pre-processed memory. For this work, we implemented four models on the basis of unlike algorithms which are capsule network, deep residual learning model, convolutional neural network and multinomial logistic regression to recognize handwritten digits. These models have unlike structure and they have showed a great results on MNIST before so we aim to compare them in real-time environment. The dataset MNIST seems most suitable for this work since it is popular in the field and basically used in many state-of-the-art algorithms beyond those models mentioned above. We purpose revealing most suitable algorithm to recognize handwritten digits in real-time environment. Also, we give comparisons of train and evaluation time, memory usage and other essential indexes of all four models."
Convolutional Regression for Visual Tracking,"discriminatively learned, ridge regression model, algorithm achieves, outperforms most","Recently, discriminatively learned correlation filters (DCF) has attracted much attention in visual 
object tracking community. The success of DCF is potentially attributed to the fact that a large number of samples are utilized to train the ridge regression model and predict the location of an object. To solve the regression problem in an efficient way, these samples are all generated by circularly shifting from a searching patch. However, these synthetic samples also induce some negative effects that weaken the robustness of DCF-based trackers. In this paper, we propose a new approach to learn the regression model for visual tracking with single convolutional layer. Instead of learning the linear regression model in a closed form, we try to solve the regression problem by optimizing a one-channel-output convolution layer with gradient descent (GD). In particular, the kernel size of the convolution layer is set to the size of the object. Contrary to DCF, it is possible to incorporate all “real” samples clipped from the whole image. A critical issue of the GD approach is that most of the convolutional samples are negative and the contribution of positive samples will be suppressed. To address this problem, we propose a novel objective function to eliminate easy negatives and enhance positives. We perform extensive experiments on four widely used datasets: OTB-100, OTB-50, TempleColor, and VOT-2016. The results show that the proposed algorithm achieves outstanding performance and outperforms most of the existing DCF-based algorithms."
"Searching Action Proposal via Recurrent

deep learning framework for generating action proposals in
untrimmed videos, where each action proposal corresponds to a
spatial-temporal tube that potentially locates one human action.
Most of the existing works generate proposals by clustering
low-level features or linking image proposals, which ignore the
interplay between long-term temporal context and short-term
cues. Different from these works, our method considers the
interplay by designing a new recurrent YoTube detector and static
YoTube detector. The recurrent YoTube detector sequentially
regresses candidate bounding boxes using RNN learned long-
term temporal contexts. The static YoTube detector produces
bounding boxes using rich appearance cues in every single frame.
To fully exploit the complementary appearance, motion, and
temporal context, we train the recurrent and static detector using
RGB and Flow information. Moreover, we fuse the corresponding
outputs of the detectors to produce accurate and robust proposal
boxes and obtain the final action proposals by linking the
proposal boxes using dynamic programming with a novel path
trimming method. Benefiting from the pipeline of our method,
the untrimmed video could be effectively and efficiently handled.

Efficient Similar Region Search with Deep Metric Learning,"geographical regions, location-based services, problem of searching, efficient branch","With the proliferation of mobile devices and location-based services, rich geo-tagged data is 
becoming prevalent and this offer great opportunities to understand different geographical regions (e.g., shopping areas). However, the huge number of regions with complicated spatial information are expensive for people to explore and understand. To solve this issue, we study the problem of searching similar regions given a user specified query region. The problem is challenging in both similarity definition and search efficiency. To tackle the two challenges, we propose a novel solution equipped by (1) a deep learning approach to learning the similarity that considers both object attributes and the relative locations between objects; and (2) an efficient branch and bound search algorithm for finding top-N similar regions. Moreover, we propose an approximation method to further improve the efficiency by slightly sacrificing the accuracy. Our experiments on three real world datasets demonstrate that our solution improves both the accuracy and search efficiency by a significant margin compared with the state-of-the-art methods."

In this work, to detect breast mass from entire mammograms, You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO), a regional deep learning approach, is used. To segment the mass, full resolution convolutional network (FrCN), a new deep network model, is proposed and utilized. Finally, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to recognize the mass and classify it as either benign or malignant. To evaluate the proposed integrated CAD system in terms of the accuracies of detection, segmentation, and classification, the publicly available and annotated INbreast database was utilized. The evaluation results of the proposed CAD system via four-fold cross-validation tests show that a mass detection accuracy of 98.96%, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 97.62%, and F1-score of 99.24% are achieved with the INbreast dataset. Moreover, the mass segmentation results via FrCN produced an overall accuracy of 92.97%, MCC of 85.93%, and Dice (F1-score) of 92.69% and Jaccard similarity coefficient metrics of 86.37%, respectively.

Our results demonstrate that the proposed CAD system, through all stages of detection, segmentation, and classification, outperforms the latest conventional deep learning methodologies. Our proposed CAD system could be used to assist radiologists in all stages of detection, segmentation, and classification of breast masses."
Integrated real-time object detection for self-driving vehicles,"Bounding, network, optimized gripping, YOLO","In this paper, an integrated real-time approach for detecting objects in the captured images of self-driving 
vehicles has been proposed. For this purpose, we model the object detection as a regression problem on the predicted bounding boxes and their class probabilities. Unlike the previous works, no sliding window or region proposal has been used for predicting objects' bounding boxes. Instead, unified neural network has been performed on the whole image which could predicts the bounding boxes and class probabilities at the same time. Our approach performs at 38 frames per second (fps) while achieving the mAP of 68.2% on KITTI vehicle dataset, which is 41.1% more than 30Hz DPM and 6.4% more than Faster R-CNN. Our approach is about 7 fps slower than YOLO. However, since it has an optimized gripping process, it has less localization error than YOLO, and a performance boost about 5.4% in mAP has been achieved."
Robust license plate detection in the wild,"state-of-the-art, bounding, frequently-encountered, state-of-the-art real-time, traffics ","License Plate Detection (LPD) is the pivotal step for License Plate Recognition. In this work, we explore 
and customize state-of-the-art detection approaches for exclusively handling the LPD in the wild. In-the-wild LPD considers license plates captured in challenging conditions caused by bad weathers, lighting, traffics, and other factors. As conventional methods failed to handle these inevitable conditions, we explore the latest deep learning based detectors, namely YOLO (You-Only-Look-Once) and its variant YOLO-9000 (referred here as YOLO-2), and customize them for effectively handling the LPD. The prime customizations include modification of the grid size and of the bounding box parameter estimation, and the composition of a more challenging AOLPE (Application-Oriented License Plate Extended) database for performance evaluation. The AOLPE database is an extended version of the AOLP database [1] with additional images taken under extreme but frequently-encountered conditions. As the original YOLO and YOLO-2 are not designed for the LPD, they failed to handle the LPD on the AOLPE without the customizations. This study can be one of the pioneering works that revise state-of-the-art real-time deep networks for handling the LPD. It also serves as a case study for those who wish to customize existing deep networks for detecting specific objects. In addition to a pioneering explorations of deep networks for handling the in-the-wild LPD, our contribution also includes the release of the AOLPE database and evaluation protocol for a novel benchmark for the LPD"
LightDenseYOLO: A Fast and Accurate Marker Tracker for Autonomous UAV Landing by Visible Light Camera Sensor on Drone,"unmanned aerial vehicle, autonomous landing, real-time marker detection, lightDenseYOLO, visible light camera sensor on drone","Autonomous landing of an unmanned aerial vehicle or a drone is a challenging problem for the robotics 
research community. Previous researchers have attempted to solve this problem by combining multiple sensors such as global positioning system (GPS) receivers, inertial measurement unit, and multiple camera systems. Although these approaches successfully estimate an unmanned aerial vehicle location during landing, many calibration processes are required to achieve good detection accuracy. In addition, cases where drones operate in heterogeneous areas with no GPS signal should be considered. To overcome these problems, we determined how to safely land a drone in a GPS-denied environment using our remote-marker-based tracking algorithm based on a single visible-light-camera sensor. Instead of using hand-crafted features, our algorithm includes a convolutional neural network named lightDenseYOLO to extract trained features from an input image to predict a marker’s location by visible light camera sensor on drone. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art object trackers both using and not using convolutional neural network in terms of both accuracy and processing time"
"A Robotic Assistant using Speech Recognition to
Create Appointments and Provide Reminders","speech recognition, robot, arduino, event reminder, voice commands, digital assistant","Voice recognition services are very common nowa-
days. These services offer a lot of opportunities to shift the
challenges of input and output between both humans and
computers to a more communicative realm. An event reminder
system based on speech recognition with autonomous features
can help to create and catalogue appointments and events of
interest in a natural and efficient way.
The goal of this project is to aid users in creating digital
reminders through the use of robots based on speech recognition.
We propose a hardware-software architecture for a robot based
on an Arduino Uno and a smartphone running the Android
platform.
The first prototype of this small robot assitant is able to receive
voice commands and move forward, backward, to the right, and
to the left as well as move its head forward and backward. In
addition, it is capable of converting voice input into stored events
and then providing aural reminders according to the date and
time provided."
Development of the Integrated Construction Automation Methodology,"Expert System, Construction Process, Central Controller, Building System, Machine Design","Current research In construction automation Is focusing on automating Individual processes Instead 
of approaching the problem from a hierarchical systems viewpoint; thus many systems being studied treat the construction site as a “hostile” environment and Incorporate many sensors to extract Information from the building. As a result, sensor and signal processing technology can be a limiting factor In the design of machines to automate building processes. However, If Integration and automation of the construction process are approached from a systems view, then existing technology can be used to design economical machines to automate many construction processes, and to coordinate and Integrate their use within the construction environment. A new design methodology, the Integrated Construction Automation Methodology (ICAM), Is presented here to assist in achieving high levels of integration and automation using existing technology."
"Minimum-Time Control of Robotic Manipulators with
Geometric Path Constraints","gorithms, led manipulator, dynamic, moving a manipula, ngparametric functions","onventionally, robotcontrolalgorithms are dividedinto
two stages, namely, path or trajectory planning and path tracking (or

Real-time obstacle avoidance for manipulators and mobile robots," real-time, described-rather, corresponding joint, visual sensing","This paper presents a unique real-time obstacle avoidance approach for manipulators and mobile robots based on the ""artificial potential field"" concept. In this approach, collision avoidance, traditionally considered a high level planning problem, can be effectively distributed between different levels of control, allowing real-time robot operations in a complex environment. We have applied this obstacle avoidance scheme to robot arm using a new approach to the general problem of real-time manipulator control. We reformulated the manipulator control problem as direct control of manipulator motion in operational space-the space in which the task is originally described-rather than as control of the task's corresponding joint space motion obtained only after geometric and kinematic transformation. This method has been implemented in the COSMOS system for a PUMA 560 robot. Using visual sensing, real-time collision avoidance demonstrations on moving obstacles have been performed."
A cause-and-effect analysis of robot accidents,"several sources, worker or programmer, accident source, workplace design","Jiang, B.C. and Gainer, C.A., Jr., 1987. A cause-and-effect analysis of robot accidents. Journal of Occupational Accidents, 9: 27–45.

Reported cases of robot accidents involving fatality, injury and non-injury were gathered from several sources (U.S., West Germany, Sweden and Japan). In cases where adequate information was available a cause-effect analysis of these accidents was performed. A total of 32 accidents were analyzed in the study. The accident effects were grouped according to who was injured (line worker, maintenance worker or programmer), the type of injury (pinch-point, impact or other), and the degree of injury (fatal, non-fatal-lost-work or non-fatal-no-lost-work). The accident causes were grouped into four categories (human error, workplace design, robot design and other) with the possibility that an accident could have more than one cause. Findings indicate that line workers are at greatest risk, followed by maintenance workers and programmers. Pinch-point accidents accounted for 56% of all accidents while impact accidents accounted for 44%. Most accidents were caused by poor workplace design (20 of 32 accidents) and human error (13 of 32 accidents).

A comprehensive cause-effect analysis was performed on 25 of the accidents and includes: the accident source, the accident cause, the accident effect in terms of human injury, recommended guidelines to be implemented, and applicable safety standards in each case. Conclusions are drawn on the effectiveness of worker safety training and workplace design, both a result of suggested standards."

Robots and humans – complements or substitutes?,"Artificial intelligence, Elasticity of substitution, Wages, Aggregation, Technological change","The effect of the spread of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on wages depends on both the form of aggregate 
production relationships and the elasticity of substitution between human and robotic labor. With a conventional production function involving labor, robots, and ordinary capital, an increase in robotic labor can have either a positive or a negative effect on wages. Alternatively, it is possible to estimate the aggregate production relationship without measuring capital or other fixed factors explicitly, using the procedure developed by Houthakker in the 1950s. Houthakker's method is based on the probability distribution of the productivity of the variable factor. Fitting different distributions to cross-sectional data on U.S. productivity, it is shown that if the elasticity of substitution between human and robotic labor is greater than about 1.9, the burgeoning of AI technologies will cause a decline in aggregate wages, other things equal. For the manufacturing sector, an even smaller human-robot elasticity of substitution is likely to result in declining wages of industrial workers as robots proliferate."
Extracting and mapping industry 4.0 technologies using wikipedia,"technologies, semantic for industry, knowledge and problems, background, knowledge","The explosion of the interest in the industry 4.0 generated a hype on both academia and business: the former is
attracted for the opportunities given by the emergence of such a new field, the latter is pulled by incentives and
national investment plans. The Industry 4.0 technological field is not new but it is highly heterogeneous (actually
it is the aggregation point of more than 30 different fields of the technology). For this reason, many stakeholders
feel uncomfortable since they do not master the whole set of technologies, they manifested a lack of knowledge
and problems of communication with other domains.
Actually such problem is twofold, on one side a common vocabulary that helps domain experts to have a
mutual understanding is missing Riel et al. [1], on the other side, an overall standardization effort would be
beneficial to integrate existing terminologies in a reference architecture for the Industry 4.0 paradigm Smit et al.
[2].
One of the basics for solving this issue is the creation of shared semantic for industry 4.0. The paper has an
intermediate goal and focuses on the development of an enriched dictionary of Industry 4.0 enabling technol-
ogies, with definitions and links between them in order to help the user in actively surfing the new domains by
starting from known elements to reach the most far away from his/her background and knowledge."
A Campus-Wide Study of STEM Courses: New Perspectives on Teaching Practices and Perceptions,"active-engagement, large-enrollment, teaching methods, campus-wide","At the University of Maine, middle and high school science, technology, engineering, and 
mathematics (STEM) teachers observed 51 STEM courses across 13 different departments and collected information on the active-engagement nature of instruction. The results of these observations show that faculty members teaching STEM courses cannot simply be classified into two groups, traditional lecturers or instructors who teach in a highly interactive manner, but instead exhibit a continuum of instructional behaviors between these two classifications. In addition, the observation data reveal that student behavior differs greatly in classes with varied levels of lecture. Although faculty members who teach large-enrollment courses are more likely to lecture, we also identified instructors of several large courses using interactive teaching methods. Observed faculty members were also asked to complete a survey about how often they use specific teaching practices, and we find that faculty members are generally self-aware of their own practices. Taken together, these findings provide comprehensive information about the range of STEM teaching practices at a campus-wide level and how such information can be used to design targeted professional development for faculty."
"Undergraduate Research Experiences for STEM Students: Successes, Challenges, and Opportunities","Undergraduate, Students , decreasing, lecture-based, provided  ","Undergraduate research has a rich history, and many practicing researchers point to 
undergraduate research experiences (UREs) as crucial to their own career success. There are many ongoing efforts to improve undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education that focus on increasing the active engagement of students and decreasing traditional lecture-based teaching, and UREs have been proposed as a solution to these efforts and may be a key strategy for broadening participation in STEM. In light of the proposals questions have been asked about what is known about student participation in UREs, best practices in UREs design, and evidence of beneficial outcomes from UREs. Undergraduate Research Experiences for STEM Students provides a comprehensive overview of and insights about the current and rapidly evolving types of UREs, in an effort to improve understanding of the complexity of UREs in terms of their content, their surrounding context, the diversity of the student participants, and the opportunities for learning provided by a research experience. This study analyzes UREs by considering them as part of a learning system that is shaped by forces related to national policy, institutional leadership, and departmental culture, as well as by the interactions among faculty, other mentors, and students. The report provides a set of questions to be considered by those implementing UREs as well as an agenda for future research that can help answer questions about how UREs work and which aspects of the experiences are most powerful. © 2017 by the National Academy of Sciences.

"Active learning increases student performance in science, engineering, and mathematics","hypothesis, performance, undergraduate, lecturing, publication ","To test the hypothesis that lecturing maximizes learning and course performance, we metaanalyzed 
225 studies that reported data on examination scores or failure rates when comparing student performance in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses under traditional lecturing versus active learning. The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 SDs under active learning (n = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (n = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6% in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the STEM disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes—although the greatest effects are in small (n ≤ 50) classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe n calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate STEM education published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms."
Improving undergraduate STEM education: The efficacy of discipline-based professional development,"instructional, undergraduate, student-engaged, engagement, availability ","We sought to determine whether instructional practices used by undergraduate faculty in the 
geosciences have shifted from traditional teacher-centered lecture toward student-engaged teaching practices and to evaluate whether the national professional development program On the Cutting Edge (hereinafter Cutting Edge) has been a contributing factor in this change. We surveyed geoscience faculty across the United States in 2004, 2009, and 2012 and asked about teaching practices as well as levels of engagement in education research, scientific research, and professional development related to teaching. We tested these self-reported survey results with direct observations of teaching using the Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol, and we conducted interviews to understand what aspects of Cutting Edge have supported change. Survey data show that teaching strategies involving active learning have become more common, that these practices are concentrated in faculty who invest in learning about teaching, and that faculty investment in learning about teaching has increased. Regression analysis shows that, after controlling for other key influences, faculty who have participated in Cutting Edge programs and who regularly use resources on the Cutting Edge website are statistically more likely to use active learning teaching strategies. Cutting Edge participants also report that learning about teaching, the availability of teaching resources, and interactions with peers have supported changes in their teaching practice. Our data suggest that even one-time participation in a workshop with peers can lead to improved teaching by supporting a combination of affective and cognitive learning outcomes."
Robotics in the early childhood classroom: learning outcomes from an 8-week robotics curriculum in pre-kindergarten through second grade,"technology, Robotics, pre-kindergarten, foundational, programming ","In recent years there has been an increasing focus on the missing “T” of technology and “E” 
of engineering in early childhood STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) curricula. Robotics offers a playful and tangible way for children to engage with both T and E concepts during their foundational early childhood years. This study looks at N = 60 children in pre-kindergarten through second grade who completed an 8-week robotics curriculum in their classrooms using the KIWI robotics kit combined with a tangible programming language. Children were assessed on their knowledge of foundational robotics and programming concepts upon completion of the curriculum. Results show that beginning in pre-kindergarten, children were able to master basic robotics and programming skills, while the older children were able to master increasingly complex concepts using the same robotics kit in the same amount of time. Implications for developmentally appropriate design of technology, as well as structure and pace of robotics curricula for young children are addressed."

The study aimed to describe the differences in dietary changes at 6 months between participants randomly assigned to use a paper record or PDA for self-monitoring in a clinical trial of weight-loss treatment. Self-monitoring adherence and changes in weight and diet were assessed between 2006 and 2009. The sample (n=192) was 84% female and 78% white, with a mean age of 49 years and body mass index (calculated as kg/m(2)) of 34.1. At baseline, the groups did not differ in energy intake, percent calories from fat, and number of servings of the examined food groups. At 6 months, both groups had significant reductions in weight, energy intake, and percent calories from total fat and saturated fatty acids (P<0.001); no between-group differences were found. Compared to the paper record group, the PDA group significantly increased consumption of fruit (P=0.02) and vegetables (P=0.04) and decreased consumption of refined grains (P=0.02). Interactions among self-monitoring and the two groups were found in relation to changes in percent calories from total fat (P=0.02), monounsaturated fatty acids (P=0.002), and trans-fatty acids (P=0.04). Frequent self-monitoring was significantly associated with total sugar (P=0.02) and added sugar (P=0.01) intake in both groups. Our findings suggest that use of a PDA for self-monitoring might improve self-awareness of behavior and dietary changes"

The contribution of this article is to propose a generic framework for conducting usability tests for mobile applications through discussing research questions, methodologies, and usability attributes. The article provides an overview of existing mobil application usability studies and discusses major research questions that have been investigated. Then, it proposes a generic framework and provides detailed guidelines on how to conduct such usability studies."
Medicinal Plants and their Constituents in the Treatment of Acne vulgaris,"Acne vulgaris, Antibiotic resistance, Antimicrobial activity, Cutibacterium acnes, Essential oils, Medicinal plants, Propionibacterium acnes, Skin diseases, Staphylococcus epidermidis","Acne is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that involves the pilosebaceous unit. 
It is a common universal disease affecting about 85% of teenagers. The disfiguring dermatosis of acne can destroy self-confidence, causing significant emotional distress. Topical and systemic therapies are available as a conventional acne treatment, including comedolytic agents, antibiotics, and various antiinflammatory drugs. Interest in medicinal herbs has been progressively increasing due to antibiotic resistance in acne-causing bacteria, side effects, and sometimes high cost of conventional treatment. This review provides up-to-date evidence on medicinal plants and the phytoconstituents used in acne treatment. The data presented in this review were gathered from several databases, including Pubmed, Wiley Online Library, Elsevier, and Web of Science, using keywords such as; Acne vulgaris, Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes), skin diseases, medicinal plants, active constituents, complementary and alternative medicines. The present manuscript provides an updated review of the most reported active constituents with anti-acne properties. Among these classes were the phenolic compounds, exemplified by anthraquinones, flavonoids, tannins, alkaloids, certain terpenes and oxygenated terpenes present in the essential oils of many medicinal plants. © 2022 by the authors."
Acne vulgaris,"Acne Vulgaris, Cicatrix, Hair Follicle, Humans, Quality of Life, Risk Factors, Sebaceous Glands, Sebum","Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disease - rather than a natural part of the life cycle as colloquially viewed - of the pilosebaceous unit (comprising the hair follicle, hair shaft and sebaceous gland) and is among the most common dermatological conditions worldwide. Some of the key mechanisms involved in the development of acne include disturbed sebaceous gland activity associated with hyperseborrhoea (that is, increased sebum production) and alterations in sebum fatty acid composition, dysregulation of the hormone microenvironment, interaction with neuropeptides, follicular hyperkeratinization, induction of inflammation and dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immunity. Grading of acne involves lesion counting and photographic methods. However, there is a lack of consensus on the exact grading criteria, which hampers the conduction and comparison of randomized controlled clinical trials evaluating treatments. Prevention of acne relies on the successful management of modifiable risk factors, such as underlying systemic diseases and lifestyle factors. Several treatments are available, but guidelines suffer from a lack of data to make evidence-based recommendations. In addition, the complex combination treatment regimens required to target different aspects of acne pathophysiology lead to poor adherence, which undermines treatment success. Acne commonly causes scarring and reduces the quality of life of patients. New treatment options with a shift towards targeting the early processes involved in acne development instead of suppressing the effects of end products will enhance our ability to improve the outcomes for patients with acne."
Dermatology: How to manage acne vulgaris,"Acne, Antibiotics, Benzoyl peroxide, Comedones, Erythematous papules, Oral contraceptives, Pustules, Retinoids, Spironolactone","Acne vulgaris is the most common skin disease that can lead to disfigurement and psychological distress. This article aims to provide a narrative updated review on the management of acne vulgaris. Methods: A PubMed search was performed with Clinical Queries using the key term ""acne"". The search strategy included clinical trials, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, observational studies and reviews. The search was restricted to articles published in English. Results: Treatments of acne include proper skin care, topical medications, oral medications and procedural therapies. Topical agents are the first-line treatment for mild-to-moderate acne and can be used as combination therapy for more severe acne. Systemic therapies are usually prescribed for the initial treatment of moderate-to-severe acne as well as for acne that is refractory to topical therapies. Conclusion: Topical retinoids are the drugs of choice for the treatment and maintenance therapy of patients with mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris. Depending on the severity of the acne, topical retinoids may be used alone or in combination with benzoyl peroxide and topical or oral antibiotics. Oral antibiotics are an important therapy for inflammatory acne unresponsive to topical therapy. Neither topical nor oral antibiotics should be used as monotherapy. Oral contraceptives and/or spironolactone are useful for many women with acne. Oral isotretinoin is the drug of choice for severe, extensive, nodular acne vulgaris but is also often used in moderate cases where scarring is evident, acne-related psychosocial distress is significant or other treatment modalities have failed. © 2020 Bioexcel Publishing LTD.

Topical herbal therapies an alternative and complementary choice to combat acne,"Acne, Formulation, Herbs; Therapy, Topical","Acne vulgaris is the most common cutaneous chronic inflammatory disorder of multifactorial origin with prevalence in adolescents. Acne is common among 95 and 83% of teenage boys and girls, respectively and affects 85, 8 and 3% of people aged between 12-25, 25-34 and 35-44 years, respectively. Numbers of topical and systematic therapies using synthetic ingredients are available since so long to cure acne. Due to risk and side effects associated with previously used therapies, internal and external herbal remedies are considered to be effective and safe alternative treatment for acne. Furthermore, scientific analysis of herbs reveals that they possess enormous therapeutic capabilities that modern medicine is searching for. With the multitude of treatment options and the rapidly expanding newer technologies available to researcher's, scientist, industrialist, cosmeticians and dermatologist, it is important to review and be aware of the current literature and studies regarding herbs and their actives role in the management of acne. This review emphasizes on the astounding effect of herbs in the topical treatment of acne with scientific datas. Inclusion of discussed various herbal extracts, gels and oils, in future developments of dermato-cosmetic herbal formulations could provide complementary and alternative therapy for acne to consumers. © 2011 Academic Journals."
"Years lived with disability (YLDs) for 1160 sequelae of 289 diseases and 
injuries 1990-2010: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010","Adolescent,  Adult, Age Factors, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Child, Child, Preschool, Female, Health Status, Humans, Incidence, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Male, Middle Aged, Prevalence, Quality-Adjusted Life Years, Sex Factors, World Health, Wounds and Injuries, Young Adult","Non-fatal health outcomes from diseases and injuries are a crucial consideration in the promotion and monitoring of individual and population health. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) studies done in 1990 and 2000 have been the only studies to quantify non-fatal health outcomes across an exhaustive set of disorders at the global and regional level. Neither eff ort quantified uncertainty in prevalence or years lived with disability (YLDs). Methods: Of the 291 diseases and injuries in the GBD cause list, 289 cause disability. For 1160 sequelae of the 289 diseases and injuries, we undertook a systematic analysis of prevalence, incidence, remission, duration, and excess mortality. Sources included published studies, case notification, population-based cancer registries, other disease registries, antenatal clinic serosurveillance, hospital discharge data, ambulatory care data, household surveys, other surveys, and cohort studies. For most sequelae, we used a Bayesian meta-regression method, DisMod-MR, designed to address key limitations in descriptive epidemiological data, including missing data, inconsistency, and large methodological variation between data sources. For some disorders, we used natural history models, geospatial models, back-calculation models (models calculating incidence from population mortality rates and case fatality), or registration completeness models (models adjusting for incomplete registration with health-system access and other covariates). Disability weights for 220 unique health states were used to capture the severity of health loss. YLDs by cause at age, sex, country, and year levels were adjusted for comorbidity with simulation methods. We included uncertainty estimates at all stages of the analysis. Findings: Global prevalence for all ages combined in 2010 across the 1160 sequelae ranged from fewer than one case per 1 million people to 350 000 cases per 1 million people. Prevalence and severity of health loss were weakly correlated (correlation coefficient -0·37). In 2010, there were 777 million YLDs from all causes, up from 583 million in 1990. The main contributors to global YLDs were mental and behavioural disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and diabetes or endocrine diseases. The leading specific causes of YLDs were much the same in 2010 as they were in 1990: low back pain, major depressive disorder, iron-deficiency anaemia, neck pain, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, anxiety disorders, migraine, diabetes, and falls. Age-specific prevalence of YLDs increased with age in all regions and has decreased slightly from 1990 to 2010. Regional patterns of the leading causes of YLDs were more similar compared with years of life lost due to premature mortality. Neglected tropical diseases, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and anaemia were important causes of YLDs in sub-Saharan Africa. Interpretation: Rates of YLDs per 100 000 people have remained largely constant over time but rise steadily with age. Population growth and ageing have increased YLD numbers and crude rates over the past two decades. Prevalences of the most common causes of YLDs, such as mental and behavioural disorders and musculoskeletal disorders, have not decreased. Health systems will need to address the needs of the rising numbers of individuals with a range of disorders that largely cause disability but not mortality. Quantification of the burden of non-fatal health outcomes will be crucial to understand how well health systems are responding to these challenges. Eff ective and aff ordable strategies to deal with this rising burden are an urgent priority for health systems in most parts of the world."
"Medicinal plants for the treatment of acne vulgaris: A review of recent
 evidences","Acne vulgaris, Herbal medicines, Infectious disease, Medicinal plants, Skin diseases","Acne vulgaris affects about 85% of teenagers and may continue to adulthood. There are about two million visits to physicians per year for teenagers and the direct cost of acne treatment in the US exceeds $1 billion per year. Evidence Acquisition: A wide variety of treatment regimens exist for acne vulgaris including benzoil peroxide, retinoids, isotretinoids, keratolytic soaps, alpha hydroxy acids, azelaic acid, salicilic acid as well as hormonal, anti-androgen or antiseborrheic treatments. However, none of these methods is free of side effects and their exact role in therapy is not clear. In this paper apart from presenting the possible causes of acne vulgaris and its available drugs, recently published papers about medicinal plants used in the treatment of acne vulgaris were reviewed. Results: Consumption of alternative and complementary medicine, including medicinal plants, is increasing and is common amongst patients affected by acne and infectious skin diseases. Medicinal plants have a long history of use and have been shown to possess low side effects. These plants are a reliable source for preparation of new drugs. Conclusions: Many plants seem to have inhibitory effects on the growth of bacteria, fungi and viruses in vitro. However, there are a few clinical evidences about the effectiveness and safety of these plants in the treatment of acne and other skin infections. © 2015, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences."

Even so, a national data profile on skin disease has not been conducted since the late 1970s. This study closes the gap by estimating the prevalence, economic burden, and impact on quality of life for 22 leading categories of skin disease. The estimated annual cost of skin disease in 2004 was $39.3 billion, including $29.1 billion in direct medical costs (costs of health services and products) and $10.2 billion in lost productivity costs (defined as costs related to consumption of medical care, costs associated with impaired ability to work, and lost future earning potential because of premature death). Based on a methodology of willingness to pay for symptom relief, the additional economic burden of skin disease on quality of life amounted to an estimated $56.2 billion. Including the economic burden on quality of life, the total economic burden of skin disease to the US public in 2004 was approximately $96 billion. © 2006 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc."
Treatment modalities for acne,"Acne treatment, Acne vulgaris, Natural, Physical therapies, Systemic, Topical","Acne is a common inflammatory skin disease which affects the pilosebaceous units of the skin. It can have severe psychological effects and can leave the patient with severe skin scarring. There are four well-recognized pathological factors responsible for acne which is also the target for acne therapy. In this review, different treatment options are discussed, including topical (i.e., retinoids, and antibiotics) and systemic (i.e., retinoids, antibiotics, and hormonal) treatments. Since the general public has been showing an increasing interest in more natural and generally safer treatment options, the use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) for treating acne was also discussed. The use of physical therapies such as comedone extraction, cryoslush therapy, cryotherapy, electrocauterization, intralesional corticosteroids and optical treatments are also mentioned. Acne has been extensively researched with regards to the disease mechanism as well as treatment options. However, due to the increasing resistance of Propionibacterium acnes towards the available antibiotics, there is a need for new treatment methods. Additionally, the lack of necessary evidence on the efficacy of CAM therapies makes it necessary for researchers to investigate these treatment options further. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI."
Herbal medicine for acne vulgaris,"Achillea, acne vulgaris, antibacterial activity, basil, berberis, vulgaris, clinical trial, comedo, Commiphora, coptis chinensis, Curcuma longa, disease severity, drug withdrawal, Eucalyptus globulus, Eucalyptus maculata, Eucalyptus viminalis, Glycyrrhiza glabra, herb, human, Hydrastis, Magnoliaceae ","Natural treatments for acne vulgaris, a common condition in industrialized societies, 
have much to offer although clinical studies are lacking. Several studies have shown that low stomach acid is a common finding in patients who have acne. This suggests that the traditional use of bitter herbs, which act by stimulating digestive function, including acid secretion, may be useful and important for correcting acne vulgaris. Herbs with antimicrobial, inflammation-modulating, anticomedogenic, and, in certain cases, hormone-balancing actions are also useful for treating acne. (See Table 1.) Acne vulgaris remains a common condition in industrialized societies, with many mainstream treatment options available. All these treatments carry risks, and none is completely satisfactory. Natural alternatives are gaining greater research support and have much to offer clinically. Antibiotic resistance in Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis has been rising steadily since the 1980s. In one analysis covering 10 years in the United Kingdom, carrying resistant bacteria were noted in more than 50 percent of patients who had acne and who were treated with antibiotics, with most patients carrying multiple different resistant strains on different parts of their bodies. Similar trends have been reported in many other industrialized nations. Despite some efforts by drug manufacturers to inform consumers, the incidence of women exposed to oral tretinoin, a known teratogen, during pregnancy has been increasing, possibly the result of direct-to-consumer drug advertising. These and other concerns, including cost, underscore the need for safer, effective, more-inexpensive approaches, including those offered by herbal medicine. This article focuses primarily on herbal treatments for acne. Few botanical medicines have been evaluated systematically in clinical trials, and there is virtually no research on the common approach of natural-medicine practitioners for acne-recommending multiple lifestyle changes along with multiple natural products. Nonetheless, biologic plausibility has been demonstrated for many therapies in isolation."
"Antibiotic resistance in acne: changes, consequences and concerns","Acne Vulgaris, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Clindamycin, Drug Resistance, Bacterial, Drug Resistance, Microbial, Humans, Microbial Sensitivity Tests, Propionibacterium acnes","Antibiotic resistance in acne was first observed in the 1970s and has been a major 
concern in dermatology since the 1980s. The resistance rates and types of antimicrobials have subsequently shown great variations in regions and countries. Illustrative of this is the resistance to topical erythromycin and clindamycin which continues to be a problem worldwide, while resistance to systemic treatment with tetracyclines has remained low during the past decade. The resistance for the newer macrolides like azithromycin and clarithromycin has been increasing. The results of antibiotic resistance may include treatment failure of acne, disturbance of skin microbiota, induction of opportunistic pathogens locally and systemically, and dissemination of resistant strains to both healthcare personnel and the general population. The ensuing complications, such as aggravated opportunistic infections caused by Propionibacterium acnes and the emergence of multiresistant superbugs, have not yet been confirmed. © 2020 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology"

For centuries, it has been used for an array of ailments such as mild fever, wounds and burns, gastrointestinal disorders, diabetes, sexual vitality and fertility problems to cancer, immune modulation, AIDS and various skin diseases. In this study, antibacterial activity of leaf and gel extracts of A. vera were tested against gram positive and gram negative skin infections isolates. For this purpose, one hundred and fifteen bacterial strains were isolated from skin wounds, burns and acne patients from various hospitals of Karachi, a cosmopolitan and heavily populated city of Pakistan, and the strains were identified by conventional methods. Among the total iso ates, 90% of the organisms were gram positive while the remaining 10% were gram negative. The gel extracts of A. vera showed antibacterial activity against both gram positive and gram negative isolates while the leaf extracts showed no such activity. In parallel, five standard antibiotics were also tested against the isolated strains. The data showed promising results in case of A. vera compared to five broad-spectrum antibiotics. Additionally, the study also demonstrated that the skin infectious isolates were resistant against broad-spectrum antibiotics.© 2011 Academic Journals."

led by Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) in the pilosebaceous unit. This study investigated whether plant Aloe ferox (AF) components may have anti-P. acnes and anti-inflammatory properties that may serve for acne treatment. Extracts of Aloe ferox (500 g) were prepared by extracting with 4 L volumes of distilled water (AFW), 50% ethanol (AF50), or 95% ethanol (AF95). AF95 was further fractionated with 2 L volumes of ethyl acetate (AF95E), butanol (AF95B) or water (AF95W). The antibiotic potency against P. acnes was determined by the paper disc diffusion method along with measuring minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentrations. The anti-inflammatory effect of Aloe ferox was determined by measuring TNF-α IL-1β IL-6, and IL-8 levels in THP-1 cells co-cultured with P. acnes. Proliferation of P. acnes was inhibited by 25 mg/mL AFW, AF50 and AF95; however, AF95 had the highest anti-P. acnes activity. AF95 and all its fractions (AF95E, AF95 B and AF95W) remarkably reduced P. acnes-induced elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α IL-1β IL-6, and IL-8). From these fractions, AF95E had the largest cytokine dampening. In conclusion, extracts of Aloe ferox had anti-P. acnes and anti-inflammatory effects, suggesting that Aloe ferox could be further studied as a potential treatment for acne. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH"

its importance as a functional food. Consequently, several literatures are rife with ancient uses of honey as complementary and alternative medicine, with relevance to modern day health care, supported by evidence-based clinical data, with little attention given to honey’s nutritional functions. The moisture contents of honey extracted from University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore honey bee farm was 12.19% while that of natural source was 9.03 ± 1.63%. Similarly, ash and protein contents of farmed honey recorded were 0.37% and 5.22%, respectively. Whereas ash and protein contents of natural honey were 1.70 ± 1.98% and 6.10 ± 0.79%. Likewise fat, dietary fiber and carbohydrates contents of farmed source documented were 0.14%, 1.99% and 62.26% respectively. Although fat, dietary fiber and carbohydrates contents of honey taken from natural resource were 0.54 ± 0.28%, 2.76 ± 1.07% and 55.32 ± 2.91% respectively. Glucose and fructose contents of honey taken out from honeybee farm were 27% and 34% but natural source were 22.50 ± 2.12% and 28.50 ± 3.54%. Glucose and fructose contents of honey taken out from honeybee farm were 27% and 34% but natural source were 22.50 ± 2.12% and 28.50 ± 3.54%. Similarly, sucrose and maltose contents of farmed honey were 2.5% and 12% while in natural honey were 1.35 ± 0.49% and 8.00 ± 1.41% respectively. The present study indicates that such as moisture, carbohydrates, sucrose and maltose contents were higher farmed honey as compared to the natural honey. In our recommendation natural honey is better than farmed honey. © 2023, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia. All rights reserved."

This study was aimed to compare the chemical composition, effect of heating as well as the time of heat exposure, and storage period on the quality of honey samples from Apis mellifera (A.m.) and Apis florea (A.f.). Methods of the Association of the Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) were used in this study. The mean values for both A.m. and A.f. honeys were, respectively: moisture (18.5, 13.7%); glucose (35.2, 36.3%); fructose (33.7, 33.8%); sucrose (7.3, 2.9%); invert sugar (68.9, 70.4%); ash (0.26, 1.1%); acidity (51.8, 98.4 meq/kg); pH (3.6, 4.4) and Hydroxy methyl furfural (HMF) (3.78, 3.17 mg/100 g). Honey from A. florea contained less moisture, have higher acidity and ash contents than A. mellifera honey. Significant alterations (P < 0.05) in glucose, fructose, sucrose, and acidity were noticed after six months. Honeys exposed to heating for 15 and 30 min at 50 and 80 °C have shown increased thermo-generated HMF after 15, 30, and 45 days. HMF reached 16.30 ± 1.1 in A. mellifera and 7.41 ± 1.4 mg/100 g in A. florea honeys that exposed for 30 min at 80 °C.

agent by practitioners of conventional medicine and by the general public. It has many biological activities and has been effectively used in the treatment of many diseases, e.g. gastrointestinal diseases, skin diseases, cancer, heart diseases, and neurological degeneration. Honey is an excellent source of energy containing mainly carbohydrates and water, as well as, small amounts of organic acids, vitamins, minerals, flavonoids, and enzymes. As a natural product with a relatively high price, honey has been for a long time a target for adulteration. The authenticity of honey is of great importance from commercial and health aspects. The study of the physical and chemical properties of honey has been increasingly applied as a certification process for the purpose of qualification of honey samples. The current work focusses on studying the authenticity of various types of honey sold in Riyadh market (24 samples). For this purpose, physical properties (pH, hydroxylmethylfurfural HMF, and pollen test) were measured. Besides, sugar composition was evaluated using Fehling test and an HPLC method. Elemental analysis was carried out using inductively coupled plasma (ICP). In addition, the presence of drug additives was assessed by means of GC–MS.

Kynurenic acid in honey from arboreal plants: MS and NMR evidence,"Honey, Humans, Kynurenic Acid, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Phytotherapy","KYNA, a Trp metabolite, shows neuroprotective activity against 
excitotoxic amino acids by antagonizing the NMDA receptor (glycine, glutamate). Here we report the identification of KYNA by a combination of ESI-MS/MS and 1D- and 2D-NMR analyses in honey varieties of arboreal origin. KYNA are absent in single-flower honeys from herbal flowers. These different distribution patterns might possibly involve an indirect plant defence mechanism against fungal pathogens and herbivorous parasites, ever-present on wild trees. The presence of KYNA in honey may explain its pain-relieving effects reported in the literature. The substance, acting in concert with honey flavonoids (COX-2 inhibitors), by antagonizing the NMDA receptor may contribute to the antinociceptive effect of honey. Moreover, kynureninates, owing to their antimicrobial properties, can favour the successful outcome of wounds and burns. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart."

"Impact of different macronutrient definitions and energy 
conversion factors on energy supply estimations","Energy conversion, Energy supply, Macronutrients definition","The magnitude of differences in energy 
supply using different definitions for carbohydrates and protein as well as different energy conversion factors was investigated. Food supply data for 1999-2001 from FAOSTAT were used for nine countries with different types of diets. Nutrient values were derived from USDA and the British food composition tables for three definitions of carbohydrate (total, available by difference, available as monosaccharide equivalents), three protein definitions (nitrogen (N) × Jones factors, N × 6.25, sum of amino acids), fat, and two dietary fibre definitions (AOAC, non-starch polysaccharide). Then three sets of energy conversion factors were applied (Merrill & Watt, general Atwater with/without energy value for fibre, and gross energy - GE). Using the same nutrient definitions, differences between general and specific Atwater factors accounted for 50-320 kJ/capita/day (10-75 kcal/capita/day) and for 290-1500 kJ/capita/day (70-360 kcal/capita/day) between GE and metabolizable energy supply calculations. Protein definitions have a minor impact on per capita energy supply values. They generate differences of less than 1%, or 4-105 kJ (1-25 kcal), with N × 6.25 values providing the highest values, followed by Jones factors and the sum of amino acids. The largest differences observed in per capita energy supply calculations are due to carbohydrate definitions. Differences of 3.5-8% or 330-780 kJ/capita/day (80-190 kcal/capita/day) are observed between total and available carbohydrates as monosaccharide equivalents within the general Atwater system. Differences in energy supply between total and available carbohydrates could be minimized by applying an energy factor of 8 kJ/g (2 kcal/g) for dietary fibre, resulting in a higher energy supply of 100-250 kJ/capita/day (25-60 kcal/capita/day) or 1-2%. Differences in energy supply are less influenced by the energy factors as such than by the nutrient definition used, especially for carbohydrates. Differences in energy supply of up to 780 kJ/capita/day (160 kcal/capita/day) or 8% may be statistically relevant and might change research results, estimates of the dietary energy supply and consequently the estimation of the prevalence of undernourishment which may affect nutrition program and policies. Global harmonization of macromitrient definitions and energy factors is important to achieve unambiguous and comparable macronutrient and energy values among countries. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Biochemical and nutritional components of selected honey samples,"Amino acid, Diastase number, Honey, Peroxide activity, Sugar","The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship of 
biochemical (enzymes) and nutritional components in the selected honey samples from Malaysia. The relationship is important to estimate the quality of honey based on the concentration of these nutritious components. Such a study is limited for honey samples from tropical countries with heavy rainfall throug hout the year.Methodology. A number of six honey samples that commonly consumed by local people were collected for the study. Both the biochemical and nutritional components were analysed by using standard methods from Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC). Individual monosaccharides, disaccharides and 17 amino acids in honey were determined by using liquid chromatographic method.Results. The results showed that the peroxide activity was positively correlated with moisture content (r = 0.8264), but negatively correlated with carbohydrate content (r = 0.7755) in honey. The chromatographic sugar and free amino acid profiles showed that the honey samples could be clustered based on the type and maturity of honey. Proline explained for 64.9% of the total variance in principle component analysis (PCA).Conclusion. The correlation between honey components and honey quality has been established for the selected honey samples based on their biochemical and nutritional concentrations. PCA results revealed that the ratio of sucrose to maltose could be used to measure honey maturity, whereas proline was the marker compound used to distinguish honey either as floral or honeydew. © by Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Przyrodniczego w Poznaniu."

Biological and therapeutic properties of bee pollen: a review,"bee pollen, honey, inflammation, cancer, medicine, therapy","Natural products, including bee products, 
are particularly appreciated by consumers and are used for therapeutic purposes as alternative drugs. However, it is not known whether treatments with bee products are safe and how to minimise the health risks of such products. Among others, bee pollen is a natural honeybee product promoted as a valuable source of nourishing substances and energy. The health-enhancing value of bee pollen is expected due to the wide range of secondary plant metabolites (tocopherol, niacin, thiamine, biotin and folic acid, polyphenols, carotenoid pigments, phytosterols), besides enzymes and co-enzymes, contained in bee pollen. The promising reports on the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticariogenic antibacterial, antifungicidal, hepatoprotective, anti-atherosclerotic, immune enhancing potential require long-term and large cohort clinical studies. The main difficulty in the application of bee pollen in modern phytomedicine is related to the wide species-specific variation in its composition. Therefore, the variations may differently contribute to bee-pollen properties and biological activity and thus in therapeutic effects. In principle, we can unequivocally recommend bee pollen as a valuable dietary supplement. Although the bee-pollen components have potential bioactive and therapeutic properties, extensive research is required before bee pollen can be used in therapy. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry."

Nutritional composition of honey bee food stores vary with floral composition,"Amino acids, Diet, Floral community, Pollen, Pollinators","Sufficiently diverse and abundant resources are essential 
for generalist consumers, and form an important part of a suite of conservation strategies for pollinators. Honey bees are generalist foragers and are dependent on diverse forage to adequately meet their nutritional needs. Through analysis of stored pollen (bee bread) samples obtained from 26 honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) hives across NW-England, we quantified bee bread nutritional content and the plant species that produced these stores from pollen. Protein was the most abundant nutrient by mass (63%), followed by carbohydrates (26%). Protein and lipid content (but not carbohydrate) contributed significantly to ordinations of floral diversity, linking dietary quality with forage composition. DNA sequencing of the ITS2 region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA gene identified pollen from 89 distinct plant genera, with each bee bread sample containing between 6 and 35 pollen types. Dominant genera included dandelion (Taraxacum), which was positively correlated with bee bread protein content, and cherry (Prunus), which was negatively correlated with the amount of protein. In addition, proportions of amino acids (e.g. histidine and valine) varied as a function of floral species composition. These results also quantify the effects of individual plant genera on the nutrition of honey bees. We conclude that pollens of different plants act synergistically to influence host nutrition; the pollen diversity of bee bread is linked to its nutrient content. Diverse environments compensate for the loss of individual forage plants, and diversity loss may, therefore, destabilize consumer communities due to restricted access to alternative resources. © 2017, The Author(s)."

Physicochemical characteristics of honey from different origins,"Bee honey, Chemical composition, Melissopalynological, Physical properties","Honey is a natural sweet substance produced by honey bees, 
from the nectars of plant flowers and honey dew. The present study aimed to evaluate physicochemical characteristics and quality of honey from different origins. Melissopalynological analysis of honey samples showed a wide variability, with samples from different honey sources being collected from different geographical origins. The colour ranged from light amber for Egyptian and Yemeni samples to amber for Saudi and Kashmiri samples. Egyptian and Yemeni samples recorded the higher acidity than Saudi and Kashmiri honey, but all samples are still within the standard limit (pH 3.40 ± 0.002–6.10 ± 0.003). The electrical conductivity (EC) ranged from 0.53 ± 0.03 to 4.18 ± 0.05 ms/cm. The moisture content of honey samples was ranged from 14.73 ± 0.36% to 18.32 ± 0.67%. Ash content ranged from 0.23 ± 0.02% to 2.33 ± 0.02%. Kashmiri honey showed the highest protein content (4.67 ± 0.171 mg/g) while the lowest value of protein content was registered in Egyptian honey (1.69 ± 0.015 mg/g). Samples of Saudi honey showed the highest value of reducing sugars (72.36 ± 0.32 g/100 g), while Kashmiri honey showed the lowest value (15.11 ± 0.25 g/100 g). The estimated fructose/glucose ratio for all investigated samples was ranged from 0.42 ± 0.02 to 2.35 ± 0.02 and estimated glucose/water ratio was ranged from 0.72 ± 0.025 to 1.56 ± 0.025. It is noteworthy that, the crystallization of Kashmiri honey was faster than other types of studied honey samples. The quality of honey was varied based on the botanical origins, handling, transportation and storage conditions. © 2015"
"Nutritional value and chemical composition of larvae, 
pupae, and adults of worker honey bee, Apis mellifera ligustica as a sustainable food source","Amino acids, Economy, Fatty acids, Food security, Minerals, Protein","Proximate nutrient compositions of dry 
larvae, pupae and adults of worker Apis mellifera ligustica were determined. Chemical analyses of the samples were carried out and the amounts of 16 amino acids, 10 fatty acids and 12 metals were measured and compared with their occurrences in conventional foods of animal and plant origin. Our results show that as the larvae progress to the imago stage, carbohydrate and fat contents decrease from 46.1 and 14.5% to 30.6 and 6.9%, respectively, while protein amounts increase from 35.3 to 51%. Honeybees at all developmental stages could be an ideal food item on account of their high protein content, balanced composition of saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty acids, and in particular their highly significant amounts of iron and zinc. We conclude that not only would bees as a source of food, feed, or dietary supplement be able to ameliorate the prospects of global food security but they could also improve the economic situation of the small and medium scale bee keepers if they themselves in addition to other hive products became an accepted hive product. © 2016 Korean Society of Applied Entomology, Taiwan Entomological Society and Malaysian Plant Protection Society"

from traditional knowledge to scientific assessment","Alzheimer’s disease, Cognitive impairment, Complimentary and xalternative medicine, Herbal medicine, Memory","Cognitive impairment, associated with ageing, stress, hypertension and various 
neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy, is a major health issue. The present review focuses on Alzheimer’s disease (AD), since it is the most important cause of cognitive impairment. It is characterized by progressive memory loss, language deficits, depression, agitation, mood disturbances and psychosis. Although the hallmarks of AD are cholinergic dysfunction, β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangle formation, it is also associated with derangement of other neurotransmitters, elevated levels of advanced glycation end products, oxidative damage, neuroinflammation, genetic and environmental factors. On one hand, this complex etiopathology makes a response to commonly used drugs such as donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine and memantine less predictable and often unsatisfactory. On the other hand, it supports the use of herbal medicines due to their nonspecific antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity and specific cholinesterase inhibitory activity. The popularity of herbal medicines is also increasing due to their perceived effectiveness, safety and affordability. In the present article, the experimental and clinical evidence have been reviewed for various Indian herbal medicines such as Centella asiatica, Bacopa monnieri, Curcuma longa, Clitoria ternatea, Withania somnifera, Celastrus paniculatus, Evolvulus alsinoides, Desmodium gangeticum, Eclipta alba, Moringa oleifera and Convolvulus pluricaulis, which have shown potential in cognitive impairment.

 of chemical substances used in today's society is assuming greater importance than ever before. Toxicity testing plays a key role in the regulatory decisions of agencies and governments that aim to protect the public and the environment from the potentially harmful or adverse effects of these multitudinous chemicals. Therefore, there is a critical need for reliable toxicity-testing methods to identify, assess and interpret the hazardous properties of any substance. Traditionally, toxicity-testing approaches have been based on studies in experimental animals. However, in the last 20 years, there has been increasing concern regarding the sustainability of these methodologies. This has created a real need for the development of new approach methodologies (NAMs) that satisfy the regulatory requirements and are acceptable and affordable to society. Numerous initiatives have been launched worldwide in attempts to address this critical need. However, although the science to support this is now available, the legislation and the pace of NAMs acceptance is lagging behind. This review will consider some of the various initiatives in Europe to identify NAMs to replace or refine the current toxicity-testing methods for pharmaceuticals.

"In vitro Alternatives to Acute Inhalation Toxicity Studies in 
Animal Models—A Perspective","air-liquid interface (ALI) culture, In vitro alternatives, inhalation studies, lung epithelium, toxicity testing alternatives","When assessing the risk and hazard of a non-pharmaceutical compound,
 the first step is determining acute toxicity, including toxicity following inhalation. Inhalation is a major exposure route for humans, and the respiratory epithelium is the first tissue that inhaled substances directly interact with. Acute inhalation toxicity testing for regulatory purposes is currently performed only in rats and/or mice according to OECD TG403, TG436, and TG433 test guidelines. Such tests are biased by the differences in the respiratory tract architecture and function across species, making it difficult to draw conclusions on the potential hazard of inhaled compounds in humans. Research efforts have been therefore focused on developing alternative, human-relevant models, with emphasis on the creation of advanced In vitro models. To date, there is no In vitro model that has been accepted by regulatory agencies as a stand-alone replacement for inhalation toxicity testing in animals. Here, we provide a brief introduction to current OECD test guidelines for acute inhalation toxicity, the interspecies differences affecting the predictive value of such tests, and the current regulatory efforts to advance alternative approaches to animal-based inhalation toxicity studies. We then list the steps that should allow overcoming the current challenges in validating In vitro alternatives for the successful replacement of animal-based inhalation toxicity studies. These steps are inclusive and descriptive, and should be detailed when adopting in house-produced 3D cell models for inhalation tests. Hence, we provide a checklist of key parameters that should be reported in any future scientific publications for reproducibility and transparency. © Copyright © 2020 Movia, Bruni-Favier and Prina-Mello."

"Centella asiatica attenuates hippocampal mitochondrial dysfunction and
 improves memory and executive function in β-amyloid overexpressing mice","Antioxidant, Beta amyloid, Executive function, Mitochondrial function","Centella asiatica is a medicinal plant used to enhance memory.
 We have previously shown that a water extract of Centella asiatica (CAW) attenuates β-amyloid (Aβ)-induced spatial memory deficits in mice and improves neuronal health. Yet the effect of CAW on other cognitive domains remains unexplored as does its in vivo mechanism of improving Aβ-related cognitive impairment. This study investigates the effects of CAW on learning, memory and executive function as well as mitochondrial function and antioxidant response in the 5xFAD model of Aβ accumulation. Seven month old 5xFAD female mice were treated with CAW (2 mg/mL) in their drinking water for two weeks prior to behavioral testing. Learning, memory and executive function were assessed using the object location memory task (OLM), conditioned fear response (CFR) and odor discrimination reversal learning (ODRL) test. Mitochondrial function was profiled using the Seahorse XF platform in hippocampal mitochondria isolated from these animals and tissue was harvested for assessment of mitochondrial, antioxidant and synaptic proteins. CAW improved performance in all behavioral tests in the 5xFAD but had no effect on WT animals. Hippocampal mitochondrial function was improved and hippocampal and cortical expression of mitochondrial genes was increased in CAW-treated 5xFAD mice. Gene expression of the transcription factor NRF2, as well as its antioxidant target enzymes, was also increased with CAW treatment in both WT and 5xFAD mice. CAW treatment also decreased Aβ-plaque burden in the hippocampus of treated 5xFAD mice but had no effect on plaques in the cortex. These data show that CAW can improve many facets of Aβ-related cognitive impairment in 5xFAD mice. Oral treatment with CAW also attenuates hippocampal mitochondrial dysfunction in these animals. Because mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress accompany cognitive impairment in many pathological conditions beyond Alzheimer's disease, this suggests potentially broad therapeutic utility of CAW. © 2018 Elsevier Inc."

Centella asiatica has been used to treat multitude of diseases for centuries. Previous investigations demonstrated that extracts from C. asiatica have a broad range of beneficial activities through their antioxidant activity. Hence, the extract from this medicinal plant could be a great candidate for anti-skin-aging agent. Callus culture offers a powerful platform for sustainable, rapid and large-scale production of phytochemicals to serve extensive demands of pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical industries. Here, we demonstrated the application of callus culture of Centella asiatica to produce bioactive metabolites. The 50% ethanolic extract of callus culture has distinctive features of chemical compositions and biological profiles. Information from HPTLC-DPPH and HPLC analysis suggested that the callus extract comprises distinctive antioxidant compounds, compared with those isolated from authentic plant. Moreover, results from cell culture experiment demonstrated that callus extract possesses promising antioxidant and anti-skin-aging activities. Pre-treatment with callus extract attenuated H2O2-induced-cytotoxicity on human dermal fibroblasts. The results from RT-qPCR clearly suggested that the upregulation of cellular antioxidant enzymes appeared to be major contributor for the protective effects of callus extract against oxidative stress. Moreover, supplementation with callus extract inhibited induction of matrix metalloprotease-9 following H2O2 exposure, suggesting its potential anti-skin-aging activity.

Results A long-term treatment of obese diabetic rats with CA extract could reverse the glucose and lipid levels, as well as the tricarboxylic acid cycle and amino acid metabolic disorders, back towards normal states. Biochemical analysis also showed an increase of insulin production in diabetic rats upon treatment of CA extract. Conclusion This study has provided evidence that clearly supported the traditional use of CA as a remedy for diabetes. NMR-based metabolomics was successfully applied to show that CA produced both anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hyperlipidemic effects on a rat model. In addition to increasing the insulin secretion, the CA extract also ameliorates the metabolic pathways affected in the induced diabectic rats. This study further revealed the potential usage of CA extract in managing diabetes mellitus and the results of this work may contribute towards the further understanding of the underlying molecular mechanism of this herbal remedy. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"Centella asiatica enhances hepatic antioxidant status and 
regulates hepatic inflammatory cytokines in type 2 diabetic rats","Apiaceae, Diabetes, Lipids, Liver, Oxidative stress"," Neutralizing the over-activation of oxidative stress and inflammation 
remains an important goal in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Centella asiatica (L.) Urban (Apiaceae) (CA) has been used in traditional folklore in Africa and Asia to treat various ailments including diabetes. Objective: We investigated the hepatic antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential of methanol extract of CA leaves in T2DM. Materials and methods: T2DM was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats with 10% fructose in drinking water for 14 days followed by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (40mg/kg b.wt). Hepatic oxidant/antioxidant status was assessed by measuring the concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), reduced glutathione (GSH) and activities of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX). The concentrations of cytokines IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1 and TNF-α in the liver were determined. Results: Diabetes increased MDA formed (47%) and reduced FRAP (20%), TEAC (15%), GSH levels (32%), significantly; decreased GST and GPX activities in the liver and elevated levels of cytokines studied. Treatment of diabetic rats with 500 mg/kg b.wt CA for 14 days decreased MDA (44%); elevated FRAP (15%) and GSH (131%) levels and increased the activities of GST and GPX by 16%. Hepatic concentrations of IL-1β, MCP-1 and TNF-α in DCA group were reduced to 68%, 75% and 63% of DC values, respectively. Conclusions: The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of CA may protect tissues such as the liver from diabetes-induced oxidative damage. © 2017 The Author(s)."
"Centella asiatica ameliorates diabetes-induced stress in rat tissues via 
influences on antioxidants and inflammatory cytokines","Apiaceae, Brain, Cytokines, Diabetes, Kidney, Oxidative stress","Centella asiatica (L.) Urban (Family: Apiaceae) is a perennial herb 
that has been used to elevate mood, improve memory, treat wounds and manage kidney-related ailments in African traditional medicine practice. This study evaluated the potential benefits of C. asiatica (CA) on diabetes-induced stress in kidney and brain of rats. Following the induction of diabetes mellitus (DM), rats were orally treated with vehicle, CA or Metformin daily for 14 days. After treatment, renal and brain levels of inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-10 were assessed. Oxidant and antioxidant biomarkers were also evaluated. Phyto-compounds in the crude methanol extract of CA were analyzed by Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectroscopy. Diabetes increased malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration by 39%; elevated levels of TNF-α (44%) and IFN-γ (20%); and reduced the antioxidant status in the kidney in comparison to normal control rats. In the brain, diabetic control rats had significantly greater levels of MDA, TNF-α, and IFN-γ (182%, 40%, and 20%, respectively) in addition to the lowered antioxidant status when compared to normal control rats. However, treatment with CA significantly reduced the renal levels of MDA (33%), TNF-α (78%), and IFN-γ (42%) while that of IL-10 increased by 18% when compared to diabetic control rats. In the brain, CA treatment elicited significant reductions in MDA (37%), TNF-α (30%), and IFN-γ (37%) levels while those of IL-4 and IL-10 increased by 94% and 20% respectively. In addition, the renal and brain antioxidant status was significantly boosted by CA treatment. Several medicinal compounds including ascorbic acid, asiatic acid, oleanolic acid, stevioside, stigmasterol, and α-humulene were identified in the crude extract of CA. Findings from this study suggest CA may protect diabetic tissues from stress via antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms that can be useful in the management of diabetic complications. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS"

YinYang bipolar logic and bipolar fuzzy logic,"Ancient paradox of the liar, Bipolar crisp and fuzzy logic, Bipolar inference, Bipolar information/knowledge fusion, Bipolar truth, First-order soundness and completeness, Gödel's incompleteness theorem, Recovery","It is observed that equilibrium (including quasi- or non-equilibrium) is natural reality or bipolar truth. It is asserted that a multiple valued logic is a finite-valued extension of Boolean logic; a fuzzy logic is a real-valued extension of Boolean logic; Boolean logic and its extensions are unipolar systems that cannot be directly used to represent bipolar truth for visualization. To circumvent the representational limitations of unipolar systems, a zero-order (propositional) bipolar combinational logic BCL 1 in the bipolar space B1={-1,0}×{0,1} is upgraded to a first-order (predicate) bipolar logic. BCL1 is then extended to an (n+1)2-valued crisp bipolar combinational logic BCLn in the bipolar space Bn={-n,⋯,-2,-1,0}×{0,1,2,⋯,n} and a real-valued bipolar fuzzy logic BCLF in the bipolar space BF=[-1,0]×[0,1]. A bipolar counterpart of unipolar axioms and rules of inference is introduced with the addition of bipolar augmentation. First-order consistency and completeness are proved. Depolarization functions are identified for the recovery of BCL1, BCLn, and BCLF to Boolean logic, a (n+1)-valued logic, and fuzzy logic, respectively. Thus, BCL1, BCLn, and BCLF are bipolar generalizations or fusions of Boolean logic, multiple valued logic, and fuzzy logic, respectively. The bipolar family of systems provides a unique representation for bipolar knowledge fusion and visualization in an equilibrium world. The semantics of the bipolar systems are established, justified, and compared with unipolar systems. A redress is presented for the ancient paradox of the liar that leads to a few comments on Gödel's incompleteness theorem."

"Uniformly Positive Correlations in the Dimer Model and Macroscopic Interacting Self-Avoiding Walk in ℤd, d ≥ 3","correlations, zero polynomially, lattice  permutations, derivation, dimensions","Our first main result is that correlations between monomers in the dimer model in (Formula presented.) do not decay to 0 when (Formula presented.). This is the first rigorous result about correlations in the dimer model in dimensions greater than 2 and shows that the model behaves drastically differently than in two dimensions, in which case it is integrable and correlations are known to decay to zero polynomially. Such a result is implied by our more general, second main result, which states the occurrence of a phase transition in the model of lattice permutations, which is related to the quantum Bose gas. More precisely, we consider a self-avoiding walk interacting with lattice permutations and we prove that, in the regime of fully packed loops, such a walk is ‘long’ and the distance between its endpoints grows linearly with the diameter of the box. These results follow from the derivation of a version of the infrared bound from a new general probabilistic settings, with coloured loops and walks interacting at sites and walks entering into the system from some ‘virtual’ vertices. © 2022 The Authors.

Random Permutations of a Regular Lattice,"Fractal dimension, Infinite volume limit; Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, Random permutations, Schramm-Löwner evolution","Spatial random permutations were originally studied due to their connections to Bose-Einstein condensation, but they possess many interesting properties of their own. For random permutations of a regular lattice with periodic boundary conditions, we prove existence of the infinite volume limit under fairly weak assumptions. When the dimension of the lattice is two, we give numerical evidence of a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, and of long cycles having an almost sure fractal dimension in the scaling limit. Finally we comment on possible connections to Schramm-Löwner curves. "
Interacting self-avoiding polygons,"Phase transition, Spatial random permutations, Weakly space filling loops","We consider a system of self-avoiding polygons interacting through a potential that penalizes or rewards the number of mutual touchings and we provide an exact computation of the critical curve separating a regime of long polygons from a regime of localized polygons. Moreover, we prove the existence of a sub-region of the phase diagram where the self-avoiding polygons are space filling and we provide a non-trivial characterization of the regime where the polygon length admits uniformly bounded exponential moments."
Scaling limit of ballistic self-avoiding walk interacting with spatial random permutations,"Random spatial permutations, Self-avoiding walk","We consider nearest neighbour spatial random permutations on Zd. In this case, the energy of the system is proportional to the sum of all cycle lengths, and the system can be interpreted as an ensemble of edge-weighted, mutually self-avoiding loops. The constant of proportionality, α, is the order parameter of the model. Our first result is that in a parameter regime of edge weights where it is known that a single self-avoiding loop is weakly space filling, long cycles of spatial random permutations are still exponentially unlikely. For our second result, we embed a self-avoiding walk into a background of spatial random permutations, and condition it to cover a macroscopic distance. For large values of α (where long cycles are very unlikely) we show that this walk collapses to a straight line in the scaling limit, and give bounds on the fluctuations that are almost sufficient for diffusive scaling. For proving our results, we develop the concepts of spatial strong Markov property and iterative sampling for spatial random permutations, which may be of independent interest. Among other things, we use them to show exponential decay of correlations for large values of α in great generality."
Spatial random permutations with small cycle weights,"Cycle weights, Infinite cycles, Random permutations, Spatial permutations","We consider the distribution of cycles in two models of random permutations, that are related to one another. In the first model, cycles receive a weight that depends on their length. The second model deals with permutations of points in the space and there is an additional weight that involves the length of permutation jumps. We prove the occurrence of infinite macroscopic cycles above a certain critical density."
Random permutations with cycle weights,"Cycle lengths, Cycle weights, Ewens distribution, Random permutations","We study the distribution of cycle lengths in models of nonuniform random permutations with cycle weights. We identify several regimes. Depending on the weights, the length of typical cycles grows like the total number n of elements, or a fraction of n or a logarithmic power of n."
Reflection Positivity and Phase Transitions in Lattice Spin Models,"Phase Transition, Lattice Model, Ising Model, Gibbs Measure, Phase Coexistence","Phase transitions are one of the most fascinating, and also most perplexing, phenomena in equilibrium statistical mechanics. On the physics side, many approximate methods to explain or otherwise justify phase transitions are known but a complete mathematical understanding is available only in a handful of simplest of all cases. One set of tractable systems consists of the so called lattice spin models. Originally, these came to existence as simplified versions of (somewhat more realistic) models of crystalline materials in solid state physics but their versatile nature earned them a life of their own in many other disciplines where complex systems are of interest.

The present set of notes describes one successful mathematical approach to phase transitions in lattice spin models which is based on the technique of reflection positivity. This technique was developed in the late 1970s in the groundbreaking works of F. Dyson, J. Fr¨ohlich, R. Israel, E. Lieb, B. Simon and T. Spencer who used it to establish phase transitions in a host of physically-interesting classical and quantum lattice spin models; most notably, the classical Heisenberg ferromagnet and the quantum XY model and Heisenberg antiferromagnet. Other powerful techniques — e.g., Pirogov-Sinai theory, lace expansion or multiscale analysis in field theory — are available at present that can serve a similar purpose in related contexts, but we will leave their review to experts in those areas"
Gibbs measures on permutations over one-dimensional discrete point sets,"Extremal decomposition, Gibbs measures, Permutations","We consider Gibbs distributions on permutations of a locally finite infinite set X ⊂ ℝ, where a permutation σ of X is assigned (formal) energy ∑x∈ V (σ(x)-x). This is motivated by Feynman's path representation of the quantum Bose gas; the choice X := ℤ and V (x) := αx2 is of principal interest. Under suitable regularity conditions on the set X and the potential V , we establish existence and a full classification of the infinite-volume Gibbs measures for this problem, including a result on the number of infinite cycles of typical permutations. Unlike earlier results, our conclusions are not limited to small densities and/or high temperatures. "
Intersecting loop models on ℤd: Rigorous results,"Loop models, Phase transitions, Reflection positivity","We consider a general class of (intersecting) loop models in d dimensions, including those related to high-temperature expansions of well-known spin models. We find that the loop models exhibit some interesting features - often in the ""unphysical"" region of parameter space where all connection with the original spin Hamiltonian is apparently lost. For a particular n = 2, d = 2 model, we establish the existence of a phase transition, possibly associated with divergent loops. However, for n ≫ 1 and arbitrary d there is no phase transition marked by the appearance of large loops. Furthermore, at least for d = 2 (and n large) we find a phase transition characterised by broken translational symmetry"
"Double dimers, conformal loop ensembles and isomonodromic deformations","Dimers, Monodromy, Schramm–Loewner Evolutions","The double-dimer model consists in superimposing two independent, identically distributed perfect matchings on a planar graph, which produces an ensemble of non-intersecting loops. In [20], Kenyon established conformal invariance in the small mesh limit by considering topological observables of the model parameterized by SL2(C) representations of the fundamental group of the punctured domain. The scaling limit is conjectured to be CLE4, the Conformal Loop Ensemble at κ = 4 [36]. In support of this conjecture, we prove that a large subclass of these topological correlators converge to their putative CLE4 limit. Both the small mesh limit of the double-dimer correlators and the corresponding CLE4 correlators are identified in terms of the τ-functions introduced by Jimbo, Miwa and Ueno [14] in the context of isomonodromic deformations."
Macroscopic loops in the loop O(n) model at Nienhuis' critical point,"Conformal invariance, Dichotomy theorem, Dilute Potts model, FKG inequality, Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition, Loop O(n) model, Macroscopic loops, Parafermionic observable, Russo-Seymour-Welsh theory, Spin representation, Two-dimensional critical phenomena","The loop O(n) model is a model for a random collection of non-intersecting loops on the hexagonal lattice, which is believed to be in the same universality class as the spin O(n) model. It has been predicted by Nienhuis that for 0 ≤ n ≤ 2, the loop O(n) model exhibits a phase transition at a critical parameter xc(n) = 1/p2 + √2 − n. For 0 < n ≤ 2, the transition line has been further conjectured to separate a regime with short loops when x < xc(n) from a regime with macroscopic loops when x ≥ xc(n). In this paper, we prove that for n ∈ [1, 2] and x = xc(n), the loop O(n) model exhibits macroscopic loops. Apart from the case n = 1, this constitutes the first regime of parameters for which macroscopic loops have been rigorously established. A main tool in the proof is a new positive association (FKG) property shown to hold when n ≥ 1 and 0 < x ≤ 1/√n. This property implies, using techniques recently developed for the random-cluster model, the following dichotomy: either long loops are exponentially unlikely or the origin is surrounded by loops at any scale (box-crossing property). We develop a “domain gluing” technique which allows us to employ Smirnov's parafermionic observable to rule out the first alternative when n ∈ [1, 2] and x = xc(n)."
Long-range order in the 3-state antiferromagnetic Potts model in high dimensions,"Long-range order, Phase transition, Potts model, Rigidity","We prove the existence of long-range order for the 3-state Potts antiferromagnet at low temperature on Zd for sufficiently large d. In particular, we show the existence of six extremal and ergodic infinite-volume Gibbs measures, which exhibit spontaneous magnetization in the sense that vertices in one bipartition class have a much higher probability to be in one state than in either of the other two states. This settles the high-dimensional case of the Kotecký conjecture. "

On a model of random cycles,"Bose-Einstein condensation, Random cycles, Random permutations","We consider a model of random permutations of the sites of the cubic lattice.

Height fluctuations in interacting dimers,"Constructive renormalization group, Dimer model, Gaussian free field, Universality","We consider a non-integrable model for interacting dimers on the two-dimensional square lattice. Configurations are perfect matchings of Z2, i.e. subsets of edges such that each vertex is covered exactly once (""close-packing"" condition). Dimer configurations are in bijection with discrete height functions, defined on faces Ξ of Z2. The non-interacting model is ""integrable"" and solvable via Kasteleyn theory; it is known that all the moments of the height difference hΞ - hη converge to those of the massless Gaussian Free Field (GFF), asymptotically as |Ξ -η|→∞.We prove that the same holds for small non-zero interactions, as was conjectured in the theoretical physics literature. Remarkably, dimer-dimer correlation functions are instead not universal and decay with a critical exponent that depends on the interaction strength. Our proof is based on an exact representation of the model in terms of lattice interacting fermions, which are studied by constructive field theory methods. In the fermionic language, the height difference hΞ - hη takes the form of a non-local operator, consisting of a sum of monomials along an arbitrary path connecting Ξ and η. As in the non-interacting case, this path-independence plays a crucial role in the proof."
Lattice Permutations and Poisson-Dirichlet Distribution of Cycle Lengths,"Cycle lengths, Lattice permutations, Poisson-Dirichlet distribution","We study random spatial permutations on ℤ 3 where each jump x{mapping}π(x) is penalized by a factor e -T{double pipe}x-π(x){double pipe}2. The system is known to exhibit a phase transition for low enough T where macroscopic cycles appear. We observe that the lengths of such cycles are distributed according to Poisson-Dirichlet. This can be explained heuristically using a stochastic coagulation-fragmentation process for long cycles, which is supported by numerical data."
Normalized multi-bump solutions of nonlinear Schrödinger equations via variational approach,"equation , parameter, normalized multi-bump solutions, the variational gluing arguments of Séré ","We investigate the existence and concentration behavior of the multi-bump solutions for the nonlinear Schrödinger equation - ħ2Δ v- K(x) | v| 2σv= - λv with an L2-constraint in the L2-subcritical case σ∈(0,2N) and the L2-supercritical case σ∈(2N,2∗N), where N≥ 1 is the dimension, ħ> 0 is a small parameter and K> 0 possesses several local maximum points. By variational approach, we construct normalized multi-bump solutions concentrating at a finite set of local maximum points of K. The construction combines the variational gluing arguments of Séré (Math Z 209(1):27–42, 1992) and Coti-Zelati and Rabinowitz (J Am Math Soc 4(4):693–727, 1991, Commun Pure Appl Math 45(10):1217–1269, 1992) and a penalization technique which is developed in order not to solve local minimization problems on the L2 sphere. Our approach is robust without imposing any nondegeneracy assumptions on K. "
Unstable normalized standing waves for the space periodic NLS,"Multibump construction, Nonlinear Schrödinger equation, Orbitally unstable solution, Periodic potential, Prescribed norm, Standing wave solution","For the stationary nonlinear Schrödinger equation - Δu + V(x)u - f (u) = λu with periodic potential V we study the existence and stability properties of multibump solutions with prescribed L2-norm. To this end we introduce a new nondegeneracy condition and develop new superposition techniques which allow us to match the L2-constraint. In this way we obtain the existence of infinitely many geometrically distinct solutions to the stationary problem. We then calculate the Morse index of these solutions with respect to the restriction of the underlying energy functional to the associated L2-sphere, and we show their orbital instability with respect to the Schrödinger flow. Our results apply in both, the mass-subcritical and the mass-supercritical regime. "
Multibump solutions of nonlinear periodic schrödinger equations in a degenerate setting,"Degenerate setting, Multibump solution, Nonlinear Schrödinger equation","We prove the existence of infinitely many geometrically distinct two bump solutions of periodic superlinear Schrödinger equations of the type - Δu + V(x)u = f(x,u), where x ∈ ℝN and lim |x|→∞ u(x) = 0. The solutions we construct change sign and have exactly two nodal domains. The usual multibump constructions for these equations rely on strong non-degeneracy assumptions. We present a new approach that only requires a weak splitting condition. In the second part of the paper we exhibit classes of potentials V for which this splitting condition holds."
On ‘multibump’ bound states for certain semilinear elliptic equations,"multiplicity results, multibump, asymptotically periodic, infinitely, associated periodic problem, only finitely","This paper concerns multiplicity results for certain semilinear elliptic equations on RN with asymptotically periodic structure. In particular, we develop variational methods to construct ""multibump"" solutions, i.e., solutions with most of their mass lying in widely separated regions. We prove the following result: for each k ≥ 2, our asymptotically periodic problem possesses infinitely many k-bump solutions, provided that the associated periodic problem has only finitely many ZN-distinct lowest-energy solutions."
Semiclassical states of nonlinear Schrödinger equations,"semiclassical, Schrödinger equations, homoclinic orbits , Hamiltonian systems","The existence of semiclassical states to some nonlinear Schrödinger equations that concentrate near the critical points of the potential V is studied by means of a local approach, variational in nature. We also discuss stability and necessary conditions for concentration. The same method is used to find multiple homoclinic orbits to a class of second-order Hamiltonian systems."
Normalized solutions of nonlinear Schrödinger equations,"Nonlinear eigenvalue problem, Nonlinear Schrödinger equation, Normalized solutions, Radial solutions","We consider the problem, in dimension N ≥ 2. Here g is a superlinear, subcritical, possibly nonhomogeneous, odd nonlinearity. We deal with the case where the associated functional is not bounded below on the L2-unit sphere, and we show the existence of infinitely many solutions."
A natural constraint approach to normalized solutions of nonlinear Schrödinger equations and systems,Elliptic systems; Min–max methods; Natural constraint; Schrödinger systems,"The paper deals with the existence of normalized solutions to the system {−Δu−λ1u=μ1u3+βuv2in R3−Δv−λ2v=μ2v3+βu2vin R3∫Ru2=a1 2and∫Rv2=a2 2 for any μ1,μ2,a1,a2>0 and β<0 prescribed. We present a new approach that is based on the introduction of a natural constraint associated to the problem. We also show that, as β→−∞, phase separation occurs for the solutions that we find. Our method can be adapted to scalar nonlinear Schrödinger equations with normalization constraint, and leads to alternative and simplified proofs to some results already available in the literature."
Multi-peak standing waves for nonlinear Schrödinger equations with a general nonlinearity,"Singularly perturbed elliptic problems, Variational methods","We consider singularly perturbed elliptic equations ε2 Δu-V(x)u+ f(u) = 0, x ∈ RN, N ≥ 3. For small ε > 0, we glue together localized bound state solutions concentrating at isolated components of positive local minimum of V under conditions on f we believe to be almost optimal."
Standing waves with a critical frequency for nonlinear Schrödinger equations,"qualitative property, nonlinear Schrödinger equation, isolated minimum points,  potential function","This paper is concerned with the existence and qualitative property of standing wave solutions ψ (t, x) = e-iEt/ℏ v(x) for the nonlinear Schrödinger equation ℏ ∂ψ/∂t + ℏ2/2 Δψ - V(x)ψ + |ψ|p-1ψ = 0 with E being a critical frequency in the sense that minℝN V(x) = E. We show that there exists a standing wave which is trapped in a neighbourhood of isolated minimum points of V and whose amplitude goes to 0 as ℏ → 0. Moreover, depending upon the local behaviour of the potential function V(x) near the minimum points, the limiting profile of the standing-wave solutions will be shown to exhibit quite different characteristic features. This is in striking contrast with the non-critical frequency case (infℝN V(x) > E) which has been extensively studied in recent years."
"Standing waves with a critical frequency for nonlinear Schrödinger equations, II","elliptic equations, nonlinear Schrödinger equations, frequency, nonlinearity ","For elliptic equations of the form Δu - V(εx}u + f(u) = 0, x ∈ RN, where the potential V satisfies lim inf |x| V(x) > infRN V(x) = 0, we develop a new variational approach to construct localized bound state solutions concentrating at an isolated component of the local minimum of V where the minimum value of V can be positive or zero. These solutions give rise to standing wave solutions having a critical frequency for the corresponding nonlinear Schrödinger equations. Our method allows a fairly general class of nonlinearity f(u) including ones without any growth restrictions at large."
Localized nodal solutions of higher topological type for semiclassical nonlinear Schrödinger equations,35J20; 35J60,"We investigate the existence of localized sign-changing solutions for the semiclassical nonlinear Schrödinger equation (Formula presented.) where N≥ 2 , 2 < p< 2 ∗, ϵ> 0 is a small parameter, and V is assumed to be bounded and bounded away from zero. When V has a local minimum point P, as ϵ→ 0 , we construct an infinite sequence of localized sign-changing solutions clustered at P and these solutions are of higher topological type in the sense that they are obtained from a minimax characterization of higher dimensional symmetric linking structure via the symmetric mountain pass theorem. It has been an open question whether the sign-changing solutions of higher topological type can be localized and our result gives an affirmative answer. The existing results in the literature have been subject to some geometrical or topological constraints that limit the number of localized sign-changing solutions. At a local minimum point of V, Bartsch et al. (Math Ann 338:147–185, 2007) proved the existence of N pairs of localized sign-changing solutions and D’Aprile and Pistoia (Ann Inst Hénri Poincare Anal Non Linéaire 26:1423–1451, 2009) constructed 9 pairs of localized sign-changing solutions for N≥ 3. Our result gives an unbounded sequence of such solutions. Our method combines the Byeon and Wang’s penalization approach and minimax method via a variant of the classical symmetric mountain pass theorem, and is rather robust without using any non-degeneracy conditions."
Multiplicity of positive solutions of nonlinear Schrödinger equations concentrating at a potential well,"nonlinear, assumptions, functional, the critical points","We consider singularly perturbed nonlinear Schrödinger equations (Formula Presented) where (Formula Presented) and f is a nonlinear term which satisfies the so-called Berestycki–Lions conditions. We assume that there exists a bounded domain (Formula Presented) such that (Formula Presented) and we set (Formula Presented). For (Formula Presented) small we prove the existence of at least (Formula Presented) solutions to (0.1) concentrating, as (Formula Presented) around K. We remark that, under our assumptions of f, the search of solutions to (0.1) cannot be reduced to the study of the critical points of a functional restricted to a Nehari manifold. "
Multi-peak bound states for nonlinear Schrödinger equations,"nonlinear Schrödinger equation, superlinear function, positive potential, prescribed finite, ","In this paper we consider the study of standing wave solutions for a nonlinear Schrödinger equation. This problem reduces to that of finding nonnegative solutions of ε2Δu - V (x) u + (Latin small letter esh) (u) = 0 in Ω. with finite energy. Here ε is a small parameter, Ω is a smooth, possibly unbounded domain, (Latin small letter esh) is an appropriate superlinear function, and V is a positive potential, bounded away from zero. It is the purpose of this article to obtain multi-peak solutions in the ""multiple well case"". We find solutions exhibiting concentration at any prescribed finite set of local minima, possibly degenerate, of the potential. The proof relies on variational arguments, where a penalization-type method is developed for the identification of the desired solutions."
Nonradial normalized solutions for nonlinear scalar field equations,"L2-subcritical case, Nonlinear scalar field equations, Nonradial solutions, Sign-changing solutions","We study the following nonlinear scalar field equation {-Δu = ∫(u) - μu in ℝN ∥u∥ L2 2 (ℝN) = m, u ∈ H1 (ℝN) Here ∫ ∈ C (ℝ, ℝ), m > 0 is a given constant and μ ∈ ℝ arises as a Lagrange multiplier. In a mass subcritical case but under general assumptions on the nonlinearity f , we show the existence of one nonradial solution for any N ≥ 4, and obtain multiple (sometimes infinitely many) nonradial solutions when N = 4 or N ≥ 6. In particular, all these solutions are sign-changing."
